Name: "krib-operate"
Description: "Operate (drain|uncordon) on a given Kubernetes node"
Documentation: |
  This stage runs an Operation (drain|uncordon) on a given KRIB
  built Kubernetes node.  You must specify action you want taken
  via the 'krib/operate-action' Param.  If nothing specified, the
  default action will be to 'drain' the node.

  In addition - you may set the following Params to alter the
  behavior of this stage:

    krib/operate-action     - action to take (drain or uncordon)
    krib/operate-on-node    - a Kubernetes node name to operate on
    krib/operate-options    - command line arguments to pass to the
                              'kubectl' command for the action

  DRAIN NOTES: this Stage does a few things that MAY BE VERY BAD !!

  1. service pods are ignored for the drain operation
  2. --delete-local-data is used to evict pods using local storage

  Default options are '--ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data' to
  the drain operation.  If you override these values (by setting
  'krib/operate-options') you MAY NEED to re-specify these values,
  otherwise, the Node will NOT be drained properly.

  These options may mean your data might be nuked.

  UNCORDON NODES:  typically does not require additional options
