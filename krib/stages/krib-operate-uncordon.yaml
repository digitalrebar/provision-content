Name: "krib-operate-uncordon"
Description: "Uncordon operation on a given KRIB built Kubernetes node"
Documentation: |
  This stage runs an Uncordon operation on a given KRIB built Kubernetes
  node.  This returns a Node back to service in a Kubernetes cluster that
  has previously been drained.  It uses the 'krib-operate-uncordon' Profile

  In addition - you may set the following Params on a Machine object
  to override the default behaviors of this stage:

    ::

      krib/operate-action     - action to take (drain or uncordon)
      krib/operate-on-node    - a Kubernetes node name to operate on
      krib/operate-options    - command line arguments to pass to the
                                'kubectl' command for the action

  If the 'krib/operate-on-node' Param is empty, the node that is
  currently running the Stage will be operated on.  Otherwise,
  specifying an alternate Node allows remote uncordon on a node.

  Default options are '' (empty) to the uncordon operation.
