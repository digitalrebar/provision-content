Name: "krib-operate-cordon"
Description: "Cordon operation on a given KRIB built Kubernetes node"
Documentation: |
  This stage runs a Cordon operation on a given KRIB built Kubernetes
  node.  It uses the 'krib-operate-cordon' Profile.

  In addition - you may set the following Params on a Machine object
  to override the default behaviors of this stage:

    ::

      krib/operate-action     - action to take (cordon or uncordon)
      krib/operate-on-node    - a Kubernetes node name to operate on
      krib/operate-options    - command line arguments to pass to the
                                'kubectl' command for the action

  If the 'krib/operate-on-node' Param is empty, the node that is
  currently running the Stage will be operated on.  Otherwise,
  specifying an alternate Node allows remote cordon a node.
