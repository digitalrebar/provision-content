Name: "krib-operate-delete"
Description: "Delete Node operation on a given KRIB built Kubernetes node"
Documentation: |
  This stage runs an Delete node operation on a given KRIB built Kubernetes
  node.  It uses the 'krib-operate-delete' Profile

  In addition - you may set the following Params on a Machine object
  to override the default behaviors of this stage:

    ::

      krib/operate-action     - action to take
      krib/operate-on-node    - a Kubernetes node name to operate on
      krib/operate-options    - command line arguments to pass to the
                                'kubectl' command for the action

  If the 'krib/operate-on-node' Param is empty, the node that is
  currently running the Stage will be operated on.  Otherwise,
  specifying an alternate Node allows remote delete a node.

  WARNING: THIS OPERATE DESTROYS A KUBERNETES NODE!

  Presumably, you want to 'krib-operate-drain' the node first to
  remove it from the cluster and drain it's workload to other cluster
  workers prior to deleting the node.
