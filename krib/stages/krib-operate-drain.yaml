Name: "krib-operate-drain"
Description: "Drain operation on a given KRIB built Kubernetes node"
Documentation: |
  This stage runs an Drain operation on a given KRIB built Kubernetes
  node.  It uses the 'krib-operate-drain' Profile

  In addition - you may set the following Params on a Machine object
  to override the default behaviors of this stage:

    ::

      krib/operate-action     - action to take (drain or uncordon)
      krib/operate-on-node    - a Kubernetes node name to operate on
      krib/operate-options    - command line arguments to pass to the
                                'kubectl' command for the action

  If the 'krib/operate-on-node' Param is empty, the node that is
  currently running the Stage will be operated on.  Otherwise,
  specifying an alternate Node allows remote draining a node.

  DRAIN NOTES: this Stage does a few things that MAY BE VERY BAD !!

  #. service pods are ignored for the drain operation
  #. --delete-local-data is used to evict pods using local storage

  Default options are '--ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data' to
  the drain operation.  If you override these values (by setting
  'krib/operate-options') you MAY NEED to re-specify these values,
  otherwise, the Node will NOT be drained properly.

  These options may mean your data might be nuked.
