Description: Install a container runtime from Internet Repos
Documentation: |
  This stage allows for the installation of multiple container runtimes. The single task (krib-runtime-install)
  which it executes, will launch further tasks based on the value of krib/container-runtime. Currently docker
  and containerd are supported, although the design is extensible.
