Description: "Contains Params that set the krib-operate-delete Stage values to DESTROY a k8s Node."
Documentation: |
  This profile contains the default krib-operate task parameters to drive
  a 'delete' operation.  This profile can be added to a node or stage to
  allow the krib-operate task to do a delete operation.

  This profile is used by the krib-delete stage to allow a machine to
  be deleted without changing the parameters on the machine.

  WARNING: This pattern destroys a kubernetes node.
