Name: "krib/cluster-cri-socket"
Description: "Specify the CRI Socket for Kubernetes."
Documentation: |
  This Param defines which Socket to use for the Container Runtime
  Interface.  By default KRIB content uses Docker as the CRI, however
  our goal is to support multiple container CRI formats. A viable
  alternative is /run/containerd/containerd.sock, assuming krib/container-runtime
  is set to "containerd"
Schema:
  type: "string"
  default: "/var/run/dockershim.sock"
