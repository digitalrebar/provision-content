Name: "krib/cluster-is-production"
Description: "Set the KRIB cluster to production mode."
Documentation: |
  By default the KRIB cluster mode will be set to dev/test/lab
  (whatever you wanna call it).  If you set this Param to true
  then the cluster will be tagged as in Production use.

  If the cluster is in Production mode, then the state of the
  various Params for new clusters will be preserved, preventing
  the cluster from being overwritten.

  If NOT in Production mode, the following Params will be wiped
  clean before building the cluster.  This is essentially a
  destructive pattern.

    ::

      krib/cluster-admin-conf - the admin.conf file Param will be wiped
      krib/cluster-join       - the Join token will be destroyed

  This allows for "fast reuse" patterns with building KRIB
  clusters, while also allowing a cluster to be marked Production
  and require manual intervention to wipe the Params to rebuild
  the cluster.
