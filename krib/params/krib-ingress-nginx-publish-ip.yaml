Description: "Optionally specifies a publish IP to the nginx external ingress"
Documentation: |
  If running an nginx ingress behind a NATing firewall, it may be required to explicitly specify
  the public IP assigned to ingresses, for example to make something like external-dns work
  If this value is set, then either the nginx ingress, or (if enabled) the _external_ nginx ingress
  will have the "--publish-status-address" argument set to this value.
