Name: "rook/ceph-target-disk"
Description: "Target disk used for ceph installation"
Documentation: |
  If using physical disks for Ceph OSDs, this value will be used as an explicit
  target for OSD installation. It will also be WIPED during dev-reset, so use with
  care. The value of the param should be only the block device, don't prefix with /dev/
  Example value might be "sda", indicating that /dev/sda is to be used for rook ceph, and
  WIPED DURING RESET.

  AGAIN, IF YOU SET THIS VALUE, /dev/<this value> WILL BE WIPED DURING cluster dev-reset!!
