Name: "krib/operate-options"
Description: "Space separted list of command line flags to pass to 'kubectl' operations specified in 'krib/operate-action' ...'"
Documentation: |
  This Param can be used to pass additional flag options to the
  'kubectl' operation that is specified by the 'krib/operate-action'
  Param.  By default, the 'drain' operation will be called if no
  action is defined on the Machine.

  This Param provides some customization to how the operate operation
  functions.

  For 'kubectl drain' documentation, see the following URL:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#drain
  For 'kubectl uncordin' doc, see the URL:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#uncordon

  NOTE NOTE the following flags are set as default options in the
  Template for drain operations:

    --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data

  For 'drain' operations, if you override these defaults, you MOST LIKELY
  need to specify them for the drain operation to be successful.  You have
  been warned.

  No defaults provdided for 'uncordon' operations (you shouldn't need any).
