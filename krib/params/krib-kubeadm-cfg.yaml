  Set this string to an HTTP or HTTPS reference for a YAML configuration to
  use for the 'kubeadm.cfg' used during the 'kubeadm init' process.

  The default behavior is to use the Parameterized 'kubeadm.cfg' from the
  template named 'krib-kubeadm.cfg.tmpl'.  This config file is used in
  the 'krib-config.sh.tmpl' which is the main template script that drives
  the 'kubeadm' cluster init and configuration.
