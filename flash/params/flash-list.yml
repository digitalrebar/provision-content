Description: List of flash images to apply.
Documentation: |
  This parameter contains a list of files to retrieve and run against the system.

  The list contains a URL or file to retrieve the files directory in the File
  field, a Force flag to indicate whether the update is allowed to be skipped,
  and an optional Script section that should contains whatever glue is needed
  to run the update.
  The Script section can take:

  $FILENAME is name of the firmware archive.
  $FILESRC is the location the firmware archive was downloaded from
  $FORCE is set to 'true' if this update should be forced.

  The Script section must set $failed if the updated failed for any reason, and
  $want_reboot if the firmware update requires a reboot.

  If the list is updated, nothing will be updated.
