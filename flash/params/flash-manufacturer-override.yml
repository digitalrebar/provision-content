Name: flash-manufacturer-override
Description: Force override the manufacturer value to flash system.
Documentation: |
  .. warning:: This is a potentially dangerous thing to do.  Only use this as a
               very **last** resort to force the Manufacturer to be identified for
               the flash process.

  This Param allows the operator to override the default discovered Manufacturer
  for the flash process.  Some system DMI data structures are not correclty
  filled out, and the flash process will fail.

  **First**, verify that the gohai-inventory Param exists on the Machine object,
  and that it the ``DMI --> System --> Manufacturer`` does not have a value
  set in it.  If there is no ``gohai-inventory`` param, run the Machine through
  a proper Discovery workflow first.

  The flash system uses the following command to get the manufacturer from the DMI data:

    * ``drpcli gohai |jq -r '.DMI | .System | .Manufacturer'`

  In some cases, the vendor may iterate a different Manufacturer value than is
  tested for in the script.  However, in these cases, please check with RackN
  to verify if the system is compatible with the Flash process.

  Review the ``flash-discover`` task.  Observe the BASH ``case`` statement for the
  exact values that are supported.  Some examples include, but this list may
  not be the most up to date, are:

    * ``Dell Inc.``
    * ``HP`` or ``HPE``
    * ``Lenovo``

  type: string
  default: ""
