Description: "Add Group Children to Ansible Inventory"
Documentation: |
  Used by `drpmachines.py` integration to add children to an Ansible group.

  The `drpmachines.py` integration automatically maps Profiles directly to Ansible groups;
  however, DRP Profiles do not have any nesting concept.  Using this Param on a Profile
  tells the integration to build a children section in the group from the list of names.

  No reference checking is provided.
