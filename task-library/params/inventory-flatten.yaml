Name: "inventory/flatten"
Description: "Flatten inventory/data into inventory/PARAM"
Documentation: |
  Creates each inventory value as a top level Params This is needed if
  you want to filter machines in the API by inventory data.  For example,
  using Terraform filters.

  This behavior is very helpful for downstream users of the inventory
  params because it allows them to be individually retried and searched.

  .. note:: This will create LOTS of Params on machines.  We recommend that you
            define Params to match fields instead of relying on adhoc Params.

Schema:
  type: boolean
  default: true
