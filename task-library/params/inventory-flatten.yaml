Name: "inventory/flatten"
Description: "Flatten inventory/data into inventory/PARAM"
Documentation: |
  Creates each inventory value as a top level Params
  This is needed if you want to filter machines in the API
  by inventory data.  For example, using Terraform filters.
  
  This behavior is very helpful for downstream users of the inventory
  params because it allows them to be individually retried and searched.
  
  NOTE: This will create LOTS of Params on machines.  We recommend
  that you define Params to match fields instead of relying on adhoc Params.
