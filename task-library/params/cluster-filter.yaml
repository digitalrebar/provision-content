Name: "cluster/filter"
Description: "Filter (for DRPCLI) used to define the cluster"
Documentation: |
  Filter used during the cluster collection phase to see if a gate can be activated.

  The filter (plus WorkflowComplete=true) is fed into the drpcli call during collection.
  This allows operators to define filters from any indexed machine properties including
  a profile, a param, a pool or even name regex.

  Since the filter is expanded in the template, operators can also use BASH variables
  if they will be present in the gate-collect task.

  Default is `Profiles=$CLUSTER_PROFILE` 
Schema:
  type: "string"
  default: "Profiles=$CLUSTER_PROFILE"
