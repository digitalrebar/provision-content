Name: "bootstrap-tools"
Description: "Defines a list of tools to install on the DRP Endpoint via the bootstrap capability"
Documentation: |
  This is an array of strings where each string is a package name for the
  base Operating System that is running on the DRP Endpoint, to be installed.

  This is used by the bootstrapping system to add packages to the DRP Endpoint.

  By default no packages are specified.  If the operator sets this Param on the
  self-runner Machine object (either directly or via a Profile), then runs one
  of the bootstrap workflows, the packages will be installed.

  An example workflow is ``universal-bootstrap``.

  Example setting in YAML:

    ::

      bootstrap-tools:
        - package1
        - package2

  Or in JSON:

    ::

      { "bootstrap-tools": [ "package1", "package2" ] }
