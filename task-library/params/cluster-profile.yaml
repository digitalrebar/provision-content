Name: "cluster/profile"
Description: "Name of the profile for this cluster"
Documentation: |
  Name of the profile used by the machines in the cluster for shared
  information.  Typically, this is simply self-referential (it contains the
  name of the containing profile) to allow machines to know the shared profile.

  Note: the default value has been removed in v4.7.  In versions 4.3-4.6, the default
  value was added to make it easier for operators to use clusters without having to
  understand need to create a cluster/profile value.  While helpful, it leads to
  nonobvious cluster errors that are difficult to troubleshoot.
