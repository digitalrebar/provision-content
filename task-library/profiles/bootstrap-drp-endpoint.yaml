Name: bootstrap-drp-endpoint
Description: Profile to perform a full bootstrap DRP Endpoint
Documentation: |
  Bootstrap Digital Rebar server with the bootstrap operations for:

    * ``bootstrap-tools`` - install additional packages (*)
    * ``bootstrap-ipmi`` - install ``ipmitool`` package and ipmi plugin provider if needed
    * ``bootstrap-contexts`` - install ``docker-context`` plugin_providder, and contexts in installed content

  Intended to be driven by a bootstrapping workflow on the DRP Endpoint
  (like ``universal-bootstrap``).

  .. note:: ``(*)``  The ``bootstrap-tools`` specification exists in the ``bootstrap-ipmi``
            Profile definition.  It is not explicitly called out here, as that would duplicate
            the pockage install process needlessly.

            The ``bootstrap-ipmi`` Profile defines the Param ``bootstrap-tools`` to
            contain ``ipmitool``.  The Param is a composable Param, so all instances
            of the Param will be aggregated together in one list, instead of the
            regular order of precedence.
