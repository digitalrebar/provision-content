  Discover including firewalld, run as a service and complete-nobootenv

  This workflow is recommended for joining cloud machines instead of `discover-base`.

  NOTE: You must set `DefaulBootEnv` to `discover` in order to use join-up
  to discover machines.  Alternatively, you can create placeholder
  machines with `.BootEnv: discover` and use `join-up.sh` to connect to the placeholder
  using the UUID. See the `ansible-joinup` task for an example.

  These added stages help for existing machines that may already
  have basic configuration (like firewalld) and a stable operating
  system (runner-service allows reboots).

  Complete-nobootenv ensures that Digital Rebar does not force
  the workflow into a bootenv (potentially rebooting) when finished.
Stages:
  - "discover-nobootenv"
  - "runner-service"
  - "complete-nobootenv"
