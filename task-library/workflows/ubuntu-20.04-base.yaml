  .. warning:: DEPRECATED - This workflow will be removed from future versions of
               DRP.  Please use the ``universal`` content pack and workflows.  See
               :ref:`_deploy_linux_with_universal`.

  This workflow includes the DRP Runner in Ubuntu provisioning process for DRP.

  After the install completes, the workflow installs the runner
  in a waiting state so that DRP will automatically detect and start a
  new workflow if the Machine.Workflow is updated.

Stages:
  - ubuntu-20.04.2-install
