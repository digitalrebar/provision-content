Description: "[DEPRECATED] Basic CentOS Install Workflow + Runner"
Documentation: |
  .. warning:: DEPRECATED - This workflow will be removed from future versions of
               DRP.  Please use the ``universal`` content pack and workflows.  See
               :ref:`deploy_linux_with_universal` and :ref:`rs_release_v46_deprecations`.

  This workflow includes the DRP Runner in CentOS provisioning process for DRP.

  After the install completes, the workflow installs the runner
  in a waiting state so that DRP will automatically detect and start a
  new workflow if the *Machine.Workflow* is updated.

  .. note:: To enable, upload the CentOS ISO as per the centos-8 BootEnv

Stages:
  - centos-8-install
  - drp-agent
  - finish-install
  - complete
