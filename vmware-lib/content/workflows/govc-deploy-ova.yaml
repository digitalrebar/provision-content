Name: "govc-deploy-ova"
Description: "Use 'govc' context to deploy OVA resources to vSphere"
Documentation: |
  This workflow first stages the a specified OVA inside the container context,
  creates an appliance from teh deployed OVA via the ``govc`` command, and then waits
  for the API services to become available.

  This process can take upwards of 60 minutes to complete.

  The deployment is controlled by the following Param settings.

  **OVA location param**

    * ``govc-ova-location`` = URL location of the OVA appliance

  **vSphere ESXi deployment target**

  required:

    * ``govc/url`` = URL for the vSphere target to deploy the OVA to (eg. ESXi or vCenter)
    * ``govc/username`` = Username on the vSphere target to deploy to
    * ``govc/password`` = Password on the vSphere target to deploy to
    * ``govc-ova-location`` = URL location of the OVA appliance

  optional:

    * ``govc/port`` = optional non-standard port of the govc/url
    * ``govc/ova-type`` = used (along with govc/ova-version) to create custom rules
    * ``govc/ova-version`` = used (along with govc/ova-type) to create custom rules

  The VCSA OVA file must be staged and made available, and referenced in
  the ``govc/ova-location`` Param.  See the full documentation for additional
  configuration Params that are available.

  .. note:: The ``govc-stage-ova`` Stage downloads and stages an OVA based on
            the ``govc/ova-location`` URL.
