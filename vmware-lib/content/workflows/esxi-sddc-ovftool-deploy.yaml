Name: "esxi-sddc-ovftool-deploy"
Description: "Deploy an arbitrary OVA appliance via 'ovftool'"
Documentation: |
  This workflow utilizes ``ovftool`` to deploy an OVA.  It requires that
  the JSON description of the OVA options is generated.  This is done using
  the ``govc import.spec <OVA_FILE>`` option.  The output is a JSON stanza
  that should be saved to ``ova/param-json``.  The ``ovftool-deploy`` task
  parses the JSON in that Param and generates an OVFTool command line
  argument list.

  See the ``ovftool-deploy`` Task for more details on this processing.

  Currently, the OVFTool command line options utilizes the ``govc`` based
  Params to describe the resource to deploy the OVA to.  The Param values
  that describe where to deploy to can be found below.

  required:

    * ``govc/url`` = URL for the vSphere target to deploy the OVA to (eg. ESXi or vCenter)
    * ``govc/username`` = Username on the vSphere target to deploy to
    * ``govc/password`` = Password on the vSphere target to deploy to
    * ``govc-ova-location`` = URL location of the OVA appliance

  optional:

    * ``govc/port`` = optional non-standard port of the govc/url
    * ``govc/ova-type`` = used (along with govc/ova-version) to create custom rules
    * ``govc/ova-version`` = used (along with govc/ova-type) to create custom rules

  Unlike ``govc`` - the OVFTool is capable of importing an OVA from a remote
  HTTP resource, so the OVA is not staged inside of the Contex Container before
  deployment - so no "stage-ova" task is required.
