Name: "govc-create-vcenter"
Description: "Run VMware govc command Context workflow"
Documentation: |
  This workflow first stages the VCSA OVA inside the container context,
  creates a vCenter instance via the ``govc`` command, and then waits
  for the API services to become available in vCenter.

  This process can take upwards of 60 minutes to complete.

  The deployment is controlled by the following Param settings.

  **OVA param**

    * ``govc-ova-location`` 

  **vSphere ESXi deployment target**

  required:

    * ``govc/url``
    * ``govc/username``
    * ``govc/password``

  optional:

    * ``govc/port``
    * ``govc/ova-location``
    * ``govc/ova-type``
    * ``govc/ova-version``

  The VCSA OVA file must be staged and made available, and referenced in
  the ``govc/ova-location`` Param.  See the full documentation for additional
  configuration Params that are available.

  .. note:: The ``govc-ova-stage`` Stage downloads and stages an OVA based on
            the ``govc/ova-location`` URL.
