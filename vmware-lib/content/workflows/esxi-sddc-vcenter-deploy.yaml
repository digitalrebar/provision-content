Name: esxi-sddc-vcenter-deploy
Description: Deploy vCenter instance on a vSphere ESXi host.
Documentation: |
  This workflow deploys a vSphere vCenter OVA (VCSA) on to a vSphere ESXi
  node.  The process requires the use of a RackN *Context* to run this
  workflow, and a Context container with ``govc`` in it.  RackN provides
  a lightweight ``govc`` only context container, or a larger bloated
  ``vmware-tools`` context container that also includes ``govc``.

  The operator must specify the following Params for deploying the
  VCSA via the OVA.

    * ``govc/commands`` - set to ``import.ova``
    * ``govc/insecure`` - either ``true`` or ``false`` depending on TLS certificates (self signed requires ``true``)
    * ``govc/ova-location`` - the URL to download the VCSA OVA from - example ``{{.ProvisionerURL}}/files/images/VMware-vCenter-Server-Appliance-7.0.0.10700-16749653_OVF10.ova``
    * ``govc/ova-type`` - must be set to ``vcsa``
    * ``govc/ova-version`` - must be set to ``7`` for vSphere 7.x vCenter version
    * ``govc/username`` - must be set to the vSphere ESXi node account to authorize the deploy operation (usually ``root``)
    * ``govc/password`` - the password of the ESXi node for authorizing the deploy operation
    * ``govc/url`` - the IP address or resolvable DNS host/domain name (FQDN) of the vSphere ESXi node to deploy vCenter OVA to
    * ``govc/template-json`` - the Digital Rebar template that describes the vCenter deployment options - there are several "EXAMPLE" named templates in the vmware-lib content pack.

  In addition, the operator may specify creation of a local Datastore on the
  ESXi node to back the vCenter instance.  See the ``govc-datastore-create``
  Stage for more details on customizing this.
