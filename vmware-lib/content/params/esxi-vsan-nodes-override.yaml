Name: "esxi/vsan-nodes-override"
Description: "If set, overrides which Nodes to operate commands against."
Documentation: |
  Normally ESXi clusters are grouped by use of the ``esxi/cluster-name`` param.
  Machines belonging to the same cluster name are operated on as a full set.

  However, an operator can override which Nodes to operate on, by setting this
  param.  The value is a space separated list of machine Names.

  There is no default value.
