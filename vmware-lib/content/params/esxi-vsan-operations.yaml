Description: "Operations to perform on VSAN cluster, typically set at the Stage level"
Documentation: |
  Defines the VSAN cluster operations to perform on the cluster or cluster
  members defined by ``esxi/cluster-name``.  Typically this Param will be
  given a value(s) on a Stage, which drives a specific set of behaviors.

  Some example Param values include:

    * ``cluster-build``
    * ``cluster-destroy``
    * ``cluster-list``

  These Param values must be supported operations within the Task(s) that are
  using them.
