Name: "esxi/object-rename-override"
Description: "Overrides the esxi/object-rename 'new_name' value"
Documentation: |
  This param allows the operator to override the ``new_name`` value
  assigned in the ``esxi/object-rename`` Param.

  This is ONLY needed if the operator needs to use Golang Templating
  constructs to inject a new_name during the object rename task.
  Unfortunately, the ``.ParamExpand`` method can't be used on object
  types.

  An example value setting for this Param:

    * ``vsan-{{ .Param 'esxi/cluster-name'}}-datastore``

  Assuming the ``esxi/cluster-name`` param is set to *cluster01*, the
  override value would be set to:

    * ``vsan-cluster01-datastore``

  .. note:: If you do not need to use Golang Templating constructs in the
            rename, do not use this Param - simply set the *new_name* value
            in the ``esxi/object-rename`` data structure.
