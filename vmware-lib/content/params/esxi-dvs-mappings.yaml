Name: "esxi/dvs-mappings"
Description: "Defines the Distributed Virtual Switch (DVS) mappings."
Documentation: |
  This data structure defines how the DVS switches should be created in
  a VMware ESXi cluster.

  This Param data structure defines the configurations of the Distributed
  Virtual Switches and Portgroups.  In addition, you must add the Param
  ``esxi/dvs-memberships`` to each *vSphere ESXi* node with the DVS switches
  to add to that node.

  Supported DVS configuration values are as follows:

    * ``mtu`` = From 1000 to 9999
    * ``version`` = one of ``6.5.0``, ``6.6.0``, ``7.0.0``
    * ``discovery`` = one of ``cdp`` or ``lldp``

  For Portgroups on a DVS, the following values are supported:

    * ``type`` = one of ``ephemeral``, ``earlyBinding``, or ``lateBinding``
    * ``ports`` = 0 for elastic, or from 1 to 60,000
    * ``vlans`` = empty or 0 for *none*, or VLAN tag ID from 1 to 4096
    * ``migrate.portgroup`` = *standard switch portgroup name* to migrate during DVS creation (eg 'Management Network')
    * ``migrate.vswitch`` = *standard vswitch name* to migrate during DVS creation (eg 'vSwitch0')

  Portgroup values ``type``, ``ports``, and ``vlans`` can optionally be left
  empty.  If they are, they will default to the Portgroup version based default
  values.

  The ``migrate`` options will allow migrating the specified Standard Virtual Switch
  portgroup specified, to the DVS Portgroup.  If they are not specified, no portgroup
  migrations will be made.

  Example in YAML:

    ::

      esxi/dvs-mappings:
        dvs01:
          mtu: 9000
          version: 7.0.0
          discovery: lldp
          vmnic: vmnic1
          portgroups:
            pg_internal:
              migrate:
                portgroup: "Management Network"
                vswitch: "vSwitch0"
                vmk: vmk0
              type: ephemeral
              ports: 16
              vlan: 10
            pg_external:
              type: ephemeral
              ports: 8
              vlan: 0
        dvs02:
          mtu: 1534
          version: 7.0.0
          discovery: cdp
          vmnic: vmnic2

  Example in JSON:

    ::

      "dvs01": {
        "mtu": 9000,
        "version": "7.0.0",
        "discovery": "lldp",
        "vmnic": "vmnic1",
        "portgroups": {
          "pg_external": {
            "type": "ephemeral",
            "vlan": 10
            "ports": 8
          },
          "pg_internal": {
            "migrate": {
              "portgroup": "Management Network",
              "vmk": "vmk0",
              "vswitch": "vSwitch0"
            }
            "type": "ephemeral",
            "vlan": 0,
            "ports": 16
          }
        }
      },
      "dvs02": {
        "mtu": 1534,
        "version": "7.0.0",
        "discovery": "cdp",
        "vmnic": "vmnic2"
      }

  In the above example, the ``dvs01`` DVS will have jumbo frames, switch
  version set to 7.0.0, discovery packets will use the LLDP protocol, and
  it will map to the ``vmnic1`` device.  In addition, it will define two
  Portgroups, named ``pg_internal`` and ``pg_external``; both of type
  ephemeral with different numbers of ports defined.

  The ``dvs02`` switch will use standard size packets, the CDP discovery
  protocol, the ``vmnic2`` device, and will not map any Portgroups.

  .. note:: You must also add the named DVS Switches (eg ``dvs01`` and ``dvs02``
            in the above example), to the vSphere ESXi nodes that will use these
            switches; via the ``esxi/dvs-memberships`` Param.
