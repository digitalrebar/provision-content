Name: "ova/ovftool-options"
Description: "Default additional 'ovftool' options to inject with ovftool OVA deployment"
Documentation: |
  This Param defines a set of standard options to inject in to an
  OVFTool OVA deployment.  This is provided as a Param, in the event
  that these need to be altered in the field.

  .. warning:: To add ADDITIONAL flags, do not use this Param, use the Param
               ``ova/ovftool-extra-options``.

  This Param should:

    * use properly formatted ``ovftool`` options
    * **MUST not repeat** any existing options built up by the Task
    * do not include **ANY** newlines in the options
    * options should be separated by a single white space


  By default, this Param sets these values:

    * ``--acceptAllEulas --allowAllExtraConfig --allowExtraConfig --X:noPrompting --X:connectionReconnectCount=5``

  .. note:: If the operator uses this Param, and would like to retain these
            values, you must also add them in addition to your extra options.

  .. warning:: Removing the ``--acceptAllEulas`` flag is an EXTREMELY BAD idea.
               OVA deployment without this option will cause OVFTool to interactively
               ask Y/N - repeatedly.  Real world impact has generated 1.1 BILLION
               requests, which filled up a 47 GB job-log file and filled the DRP
               backing filesystem.  **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**.

  As an alternative for command line option parsing, see the Param
  ``ova/ovaftool-deploy-more-mapping-template`` - which is a MUCH more
  advanced use case alternative.
