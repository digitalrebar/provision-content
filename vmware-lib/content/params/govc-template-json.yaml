Name: "govc/template-json"
Description: "Render a template inside the govc context container."
Documentation: |
  Render the template named in this Param, to the govc context container.  Several
  of the govc commands require a config file passed in to the command.  For example,
  the OVA deploy option requires a JSON template to configure the deployed OVA.

  This template will be rendered to ``/tmp/template.json`` inside the container
  for use by the ``govc/command``.  For example, to deploy an OVA, save your OVA
  JSON template to the DRP system, assign the template name to this Param, and
  then set the `govc/template`` accordingly.

  Example:
    ::

      set Param ``govc/template-json`` to: ``vcsa-esxi-uefi.json``
      which will be rendered to:  ``/tmp/template.json``
      govc/command reference:  ``govc import.ova -options=/tmp/template.json OVA_LOCATION``
      OVA_LOCATION: would be the resource URL for the ``user:password@address` of ESXi or vCenter

  Unfortunately, it appears the GoVC command is not able to utilize a remote HTTP path
  as the JSON template input.  This is true at least up until version 0.22.0 of GoVC.
