Name: "govc/template-json"
Description: "Render a template inside the govc context container."
Documentation: |
  Render the template named in this Param, to the govc context container.  Several
  of the govc commands require a JSON config file passed in to the command.  For example,
  the OVA deploy option requires a JSON template to configure the deployed OVA.

  This template will be rendered to ``/tmp/template.json`` inside the container
  for use by the ``govc/commands``.  For example, to deploy an OVA, save your OVA
  JSON template to the DRP system, assign the template name to this Param, and
  then set the ``govc/template`` accordingly.

  Unfortunately, it appears the GoVC command is not able to utilize a remote HTTP path
  as the JSON template input.  This is true at least up until version 0.22.1 of GoVC.
