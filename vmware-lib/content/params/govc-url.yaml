Name: "govc/url"
Description: "Full ESXi or vCenter URL resource to connect to."
Documentation: |
  The full VMware ESXi or vCenter URL resource to connect to, to execute a
  ``govc/command`` against.

  Example:  ``root:RocketSkates@192.168.1.10``

  You must include the ``user:pass`` credentials if you sue this format.

  There are two paths to configure the Resource URL, either this
  Param, or leave this Param empty, and specify all three required Param
  values, and the one optional:

  All three required if ``govc/url`` is not used:
  ::

    govc/username:  user
    govc/password:  s3cr3t
    govc/node: 192.168.1.10

  Optional (defaults to '443'):
  ::

    govc/port: 1443

  By default this Param has an empty value.

Schema:
  type: "string"
  default: ""
Meta:
  color: "green"
  icon: "terminal"
  title: "RackN Content"
