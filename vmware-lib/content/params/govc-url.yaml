Name: "govc/url"
Description: "ESXi or vCenter URL resource to connect to."
Documentation: |
  The VMware ESXi or vCenter URL resource to connect to, to execute a
  ``govc/commands`` against.

  * Example:  ``192.168.1.10``
  * Example:  ``vc01.example.com``
  * Example:  ``vc01.example.com:1443``

  You must also specify the accompanying ``govc`` configuration Params,
  to successfully connect and authenticate.

  Required:
  ::

    govc/url:  192.168.124.109
    govc/username:  root
    govc/password:  s3cr3t

  Optional (defaults to '443'):
  ::

    govc/port: 1443

  .. note:: Previous versions allowed single Param specification in
            the ``govc/url`` param.  As of ``vmware-lib`` ``v4.4.0``,
            it is no longer supported in recent *govc* versions, so
            that usage is also removed form Digital Rebar.
