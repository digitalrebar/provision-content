  Render the template named in this Param, to the vcsa-deploy context container.

  This template will be rendered to ``/tmp/template.json`` inside the container
  for use by the ``vcsa-deploy/command``.  For example, to deploy an OVA, save your OVA
  JSON template to the DRP system, assign the template name to this Param, and
  then set the ``vcsa-deploy/template-json`` Param accordingly.

      set Param ``vcsa-deploy/template-json`` to: ``vcsa-esxi-uefi.json``
      # which will be rendered to:  ``/tmp/template.json``
      set Param ``vcsa-deploy/command``:  ``vcsa-deploy install /tmp/template.json <OPTIONS>``
