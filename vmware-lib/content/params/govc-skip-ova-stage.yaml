Name: "govc/skip-ova-stage"
Description: "Allow skipping the OVA stage process in a workflow if set to 'true'"
Documentation: |
  If set to ``true``, then skip the ``govc-stage-ova`` staging process in
  a workflow.  Some tools that utilize an OVA import/load process can do
  so from a remote HTTP URL path, and do not require the OVA local on the
  filesystem (which ``govc`` requires).

  By default this value is set to ``false``.
