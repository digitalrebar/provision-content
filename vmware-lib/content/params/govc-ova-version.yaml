Name: "govc/ova-version"
Description: "The OVA appliance version that is being deployed (optional - maybe)."
Documentation: |
  The version of the OVA Resource that is deployed via the ``govc/command``.

  Various OVA appliances exhibit unique and strange behaviors that need to be
  accounted for by the Digital Rebar deployment tooling at times.

  For example, the VCSA 6.x OVA deployment; when complete, uses 'root@vsphere.local'
  account name.  This is used by the ``govc-wait-for-vcenter`` task to verify
  the API is fully up, and the deployment is complete.  *However*, in VCSA 7.x
  the username is secretly and mystically changed to 'administrator@vsphere.local'.

  Setting the ``govc/ova-type`` to ``vcsa``, and this Param to ``7``, allows the
  tooling to switch auth accounts.

  In the future, if unique rules in various places are required, then the combination
  of "ova-type" and "ova-version" can be codified in the tooling to react accordingly.
