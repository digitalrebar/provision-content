Name: "ova/ovftool-extra-options"
Description: "Extra 'ovftool' options to inject with ovftool OVA deployment"
Documentation: |
  This Param allows the operator to inject any specific additional
  options to the ``ovftool`` command when doing an OVA deployment.

  This Param should:

    * use properly formatted ``ovftool`` options
    * **MUST NOT** repeat any existing options built up by the Task
    * do not include **ANY** newlines in the options
    * options should be separated by a single white space

  By default, this Param does not specify a ``default`` value.

  .. note:: Do not use ``ova/ovftool-options`` for additional options,
            this Param is the correct one to insert additional flags.

  As an alternative for command line option parsing, see the Param
  ``ova/ovaftool-deploy-more-mapping-template`` - which is a MUCH more
  advanced use case alternative.

  **Example:** enhancing the OVFtool standard output to provide more
  verbose details if there are problems deploying an OVA, set this
  extra options Param as follows:

    * ``--X:logToConsole=True --X:logLevel="verbose"``

  Rerun the deployment Stage/Task, and now the job-log should have much
  more verbose logged output for troubleshooting.

  type: "string"
