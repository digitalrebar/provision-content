Name: "ova/ovftool-extra-options"
Description: "Extra 'ovftool' options to inject with ovftool OVA deployment"
Documentation: |
  This Param allows the operator to inject any specific additional
  options to the ``ovftool`` command when doing an OVA deployment.

  This Param should:

    * use properly formatted ``ovftool`` options
    * not repeat any existing options built up by the Task
    * do not include **ANY** newlines in the options
    * options should be separated by a single white space

  Example value for this Param:

    * ``--skipManifestCheck --defaultStorageProfile=my-storage-profile --prop:Foo=Bar``

  By default, this Param sets the commonly used values:

    * ``--acceptAllEulas --allowAllExtraConfig --allowExtraConfig``

  .. warning:: If the operator uses this Param, and would like to retain these
                values, you must also add them in addition to your extra options.

  As an alternative for command line option parsing, see the Param
  ``ova/ovaftool-deploy-more-mapping-template`` - which is a MUCH more
  advanced use case alternative.
