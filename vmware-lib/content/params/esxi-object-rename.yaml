Name: "esxi/object-rename"
Description: "Defines a vSphere object to be renamed."
Documentation: |
  This data structure defines a vSphere object that should be renamed.
  An example task that uses it is the ``esxi-object-rename``, which
  utilizes the Ansible Galaxy VMware modules and the playbook named
  ``vmware_rename_object``.

  The top-level object is a reference name to group rename operations
  together.  This allows the operator to specify more than a single
  rename operation using the single Param data structure.

  Requires the vCenter or ESXi authentication information is passed in via
  the ``govc/*`` Param values.

  The following values are required:

    * ``new_name`` - the new name of the renamed object
    * ``object_type`` - the new name of the renamed object

  In addition, *only one* of the following may be specified:

    * ``object_name`` - the object name in the inventory (mutually exclussive with ``object_moid``)
    * ``object_moid - the *managed object identifier* (mutually exclussive with ``object_name``)

  For the ``object_type``, only the following values are valid:

    * ``Cluster``
    * ``ClusterComputeResource``
    * ``Datacenter``
    * ``Datastore``
    * ``Folder``
    * ``ResourcePool``
    * ``VM`` or ``VirtualMachine``

  Example in YAML:

    ::

      esxi/object-rename:
        vsan-datastore:
          new_name: "vsan-cluster01-datastore"
          object_name: "vsanDataStore"
          object_type: "Datastore"
        vm-generic:
          new_name: "Fedora_31"
          object_name: "Fedora_VM"
          object_type: "VirtualMachine"

  Example in JSON:

    ::

      "vsan-datastore": {
        "new_name": "vsan-cluster01-datastore",
        "object_name": "vsanDataStore",
        "object_type": "Datastore"
      }
      "vm-generic": {
        "new_name": "fedora-vm01",
        "object_name": "Fedora_VM",
        "object_type": "VirtualMachine"
      }

  In the above example, the VSAN Datastore named *vsanDataStore* should
  be renamed to ``vsan-cluster01-datastore``.  Subsequently, the Virtual
  Machine named *Fedora_VM* will be renamed to ``fedora-vm01``.

  .. note:: If a Golang Templating construct is desired for the *new_name*
            value, set the ``esxi/object-rename-override`` for the *new_name*
            value.  In that case, this objects setting will be ignored.
