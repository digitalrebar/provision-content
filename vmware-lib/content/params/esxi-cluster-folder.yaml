Name: "esxi/cluster-folder"
Description: "Defines the folder name that the cluster should be added to ."
Documentation: |
  A string of the folder name that the cluster should be added to
  for inventory management.

  For example, if the ``esxi/cluster-name`` is set to ``honey-nut``, and
  the ``esxi/cluster-folder`` is set to ``cereal``, then the Cluster
  will be added to the ``cereal`` folder when it is created.

  Multi-level paths are allowed (eg ``/cereal/honey-nut/box``).  Parent directories
  that do not exist will be created in order appropriately.

  The string will be interpreted and expanded by the Golang Templating engine
  at time of use, so an example construct as follows is allowed:

    * ``/{{ .Param "esxi/datacenter-name" }}/{{ .Param "esxi/cluster-name" }}``

  If the values of the above params have been set to *dc01* and *cluster01*
  (respectively), then the rendered result will be:

    * ``/dc01/cluster01``
