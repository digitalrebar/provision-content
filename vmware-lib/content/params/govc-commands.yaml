Name: "govc/commands"
Description: "Command to for 'govc' to run."
Documentation: |
  An array of strings for ``govc`` to run.  Each array string will be
  run in order defined in when the Param is populated.

  Only a single ``import.ova`` command can be specified in any single
  set of commands to run.

  Defaults to ``govc about`` command.

  As an example, you can print the ``govc`` environment which affects the
  runtime operation of the ``govc`` command, using ``govc env``.  To use
  this command, set the Param to the value ``env``.
 
  .. note::  Do not specify ``govc`` ifself.

  YAML Example of setting multiple commands to run in a single Task run:

    ::

      govc/commands:
        - "about"
        - "env"
        - "datastore.ls"
