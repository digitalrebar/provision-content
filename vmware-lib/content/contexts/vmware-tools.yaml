Name: vmware-tools
Description: 'vmware-tools context using image vmware-tools:latest'
Documentation: |
  The ``vmware-tools`` context is an enormous fat bloated Container image that
  contains pretty much every imaginable tool for interacting with and managing
  VMware vSphere and Cloud Foundation (VCF) API services.  This context is used
  by several of the Workflows in the ``vmware-lib`` content pack for higher
  level API interaction with ESXi or vSphere vCenter and Cloud Foundation services.

  The tools included are:

    * govc - Golang compiled binary from the govmomi library
    * pyvmomi - Python library
    * ovftool - for deployment of OVA appliance packages
    * powershell - for PowerShell scripted language support
    * powercli - PowerCLI addon for PowerShell
    * vmware perl libraries
    * vmware SDK Python standalone libraries (vsphere-automation-sdk-python)
    * Ansible
    * Ansible VMware Galaxy modules
    * Python3
    * various utility tools (curl, wget, git, yq, jq, etc.)
    * RackN ``drpcli`` client

  The container also runs an Agent (runner) for executing Workflow stage/tasks.

  Expect that the first invocation run of this Context may take as long as 1 or 2
  minutes for the container to startup, as it is over 1 GB in size.
