Name: "govc-ova-stage"
Description: "A task to stage the OVA inside the container Context"
Documentation: |
  This tasks stages the specified OVA in ``govc/ova-location`` Param inside
  the container Context.  Unfortunately, the _govc_ command does not appear
  to have support to specify remote resources as an HTTP/S URL reference.

  The OVA specified in the Param will be downloaded inside the container as
  a file named _import.ova_, which if that file exists, the ``govc-command``
  Task will append to the end of the executed _govc_ arguments.

RequiredParams:
  - "govc/ova-location"
OptionalParams: []
Templates:
  - Name: "govc-stage-ova.sh"
    Contents: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      # Stage the OVA resource inside the container as 'import.ova'
