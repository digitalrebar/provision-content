Description: "govc VCSA deployment test profile for ewr1 test environment"
Documentation: |
  Runs ``govc`` to deploy a test VCSA deployment.  Requires that the VCSA configuration
  JSON file be saved to the context container as ``/tmp/template.json`` prior to the
  command being run.

  The ``govc-command`` task reads the ``govc/template-json`` Param
  and writes the referenced template to the temporary json location.
