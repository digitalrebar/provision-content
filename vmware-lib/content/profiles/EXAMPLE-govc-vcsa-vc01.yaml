Documentation: |
  .. warning:: THIS IS AN EXAMPLE - you must modify values to fit your
               local environment appropriately.

  Runs ``govc`` to deploy a test VCSA deployment.  Requires that the VCSA configuration
  JSON file be saved to the context container as ``/tmp/template.json`` prior to the
  command being run.

  The ``govc-command`` task reads the ``govc/template-json`` Param
  and writes the referenced template to the temporary json location.
