  .. warning:: THIS IS AN EXAMPLE - you must modify values to fit your
               local environment appropriately.

  Runs ``vcsa-deploy`` to deploy a test VCSA deployment.  Requires that the VCSA
  configuration JSON file be saved to the context container as ``/tmp/template.json``
  prior to the command being run.

  The ``vcsa-deploy-command`` task reads the ``vcsa-deploy/template-json`` Param
  and writes the referenced template to the temporary json location.
