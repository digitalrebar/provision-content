Description: Basic RHEL Install Workflow + Runner
Documentation: |
  This workflow includes the DRP Runner in RHEL provisioning process for DRP.

  After the install completes, the workflow installs the runner
  in a waiting state so that DRP will automatically detect and start a
  new workflow if the Machine.Workflow is updated.

  NOTE: To enable, upload the RHEL ISO as per the rhel-7-install BootEnv
