Name: rhel-server-7-reset
Description: Basic RHEL Install Workflow, Register, and Runner
Documentation: |
  This workflow includes the DRP Runner in RHEL provisioning process for DRP.
  It also will register the system with Redhat Subscription Manager.  Requires
  the ``redhat/subscription-username`` and ``redhat/subscription-password``
  Params are specified with values that have entitlement for Redhat Server
  subscritpion.

  After the install completes, the workflow installs the runner
  in a waiting state so that DRP will automatically detect and start a
  new workflow if the Machine.Workflow is updated.
