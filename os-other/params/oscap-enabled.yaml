Name: "oscap/enabled"
Description: "Set the OpenSCAP kickstart/preseed rendering on or off"
Documentation: |
  This param enables or disables rendering OpenSCAP configuration elements
  in to the Kickstart or Preseed files during OS installation.

  By default, this is disabled (``false``).

  In addition to setting this to ``true``, the operator must define which
  OpenSCAP profile, packages, and configuration should be supported.  This
  is done by setting the ``oscap/configuration`` map on the Machine.  Examples
  can be found in the ``oscap/configuration`` Param documentation.

  Additional details about the OpenSCAP system an possible values can be
  found in Redhat's RHEL guides and the OpenSCAP websites:
