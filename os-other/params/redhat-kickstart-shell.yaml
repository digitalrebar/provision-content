Name: "redhat/kickstart-shell"
Description: "Activates the kickstart SSH shell if specified (default: True)"
Documentation: |
  During the Kickstart installation process, it is now possible in RHEL and
  CentOS to activate an SSH login and shell for debugging or troubleshooting
  while the system is installing.

  This param by default will activate the SSH Shell and use the defaults of
  ``rocketskates`` for username, and password of ``RocketSkates`` for that user.
  These values can be overridden with the use of the ``provisioner-default-user``
  and ``provisioner-default-password-hash`` Params.

  Additionally, if an SSH Public key half is provided in ``provisioner-access-key``,
  then that SSH Public key half will be added to the ``authorized_keys``.
