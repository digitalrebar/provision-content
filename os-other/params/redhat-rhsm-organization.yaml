Name: "redhat/rhsm-organization"
Description: "RedHat Subscription Network organization information"
Documentation: |
  Specifies the Redhat Subscription Network information used by the installation
  process to register systems during installs.

  The the subscription must be activated in advance for systems to be registered
  during installation.  This is typically done through the RHSN web portal, or
  other tools.

    * RHSN Portal: https://access.redhat.com/management

  This Params does NOT have a defined *default* value, as the kickstart template uses
  the non-existence (``.ParamExists``) check to trigger injecting the ``rhsm``
  directive.

  .. note:: The ``redhat/rhsm-organization`` and ``redhat/rhsm-activation`` values are
  **BOTH** required Params if the install time activation is requested.
