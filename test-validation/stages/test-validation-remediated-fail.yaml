Name: "test-validation-remediated-fail"
Description: "Perform validation test fail immediately that is marked success on second attempt."
Documentation: |
  This test should complete the following tasks:

    * success
    * fail - immediately the system will stop
    * TEST OPERATOR: restart the runner on the Machine
    * remediateion control flags will mark task remediated
    * workflow resumes - failed task should succeeed
    * success
    * remediation control flags will be removed

  The workflow should stop immediately at the fail task.  The operator sets the
  override Param (``test-validation/remdiated`` to ``true``).  Once the Workflow
  is restarted, the ``test-validation-fail-immediately`` Task will succeed after
  evaluating the remediated Param.

  The second workflow run should succeed and the final success test task should
  also succeed.
