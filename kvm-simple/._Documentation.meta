KVM Simple
----------

This content pack does a very fast and opinionated basic (simple)
installation of KVM on the following systems:

  * CentOS 7
  * CentOS 8
  * Ubuntu 18.04

Other distros that track compatibility with the above versions, package
names, and command structures may potentially work too.

No post-install configuration or setup of the KVM environment is done
at this time.  For example, no Bridges or network related configurations
for the Virtual machines.

Additionally - the default DHCP service (likely ``dnsmasq``) is still running,
which may present a potential conflict with the DRP Endpoint DHCP services
if they are on the same Layer 2 network as the KVM hypervisor systems.
