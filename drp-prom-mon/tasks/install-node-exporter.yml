Name: "install-node-exporter"
Description: "A task to Install Node Exporter for Prometheus"
Documentation: |
  This task installs the Node Exporter package on a given machine.
  It also will record the Node Exporter systems IP address in the
  param 'drp-prom-mon/node-exporter'.  This value will subsequently
  be used by the Prometheus Stage to collect (scrape) metrics from
  this machine.

  The Param 'drp-prom-mon/cluster-profile' MUST BE SET on the machine
  so that the Stage can record the Pram information correctly.

  If the Param 'drp-prom-mon/cluster-profile' is set to the value

    ::

      prom-mon-single-node

  Then the Stage will assume this is an all-in-one DRP/Prometheus/
  Node Exporter/Grafana platform - and you DO NOT have to set the
  cluster profile.
