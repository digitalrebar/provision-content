Name: "install-node-exporter"
Description: "Install Node Exporter - MUST clone this and apply to Machines"
Documentation: |
  Installs the Node Exporter on a target machine.

  You MUST set the ``drp-prom-mon/cluster-profile`` Param to the
  name of the Profile that stores your cluster state if you are
  configuring for Node Exporter and Prometheus services.

  The ``cfg-node-exporter.sh.tmpl`` Template will collect the Machines
  IP Address and add the Param ``drp-prom-mon/node-exporter`` to the
  cluster profile.  DO NOT create the Param, otherwise, the template
  will fail with an error.
