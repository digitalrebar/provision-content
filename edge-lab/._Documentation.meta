Edge Lab Reference Environment
==============================

Assumptions:
* the leader node have internet access for downloading `containerd` and `k3s` binaries
* all nodes have have internet access for downloading containers
* `drpcli` has been installed on client system

Edge Lab requires Digital Rebar Platform tip (post v4.2) due to RPi install requirements.

Building & Installing DRP on Edge Lab
-------------------------------------

Please see the documentation in https://github.com/digitalrebar/edgelab for building the physical environment.

Setup Edge Lab Content
----------------------

Note: make sure that you `export RS_ENDPOINT` to your endpoint!

Edge Lab (edge-lab) is available in the RackN Catalog, you
can install it using `drpcli catalog item install edge-lab`
This was done for you as part of the bootstrapping process.

To manually create and upload:

#. clone edge-lab with DRP content: `git clone https://github.com/digitalrebar/provision-content`
#. got to the edge-lab content: `cd provision-content\edge-lab`
#. build the content pack: `drpcli contents bundle edge-lab.yaml`
#. install the `edge-lab` content pack: `drpcli contents upload edge-lab.yaml`

If you make changes, you can repeat steps 3 and 4 to upload the latest content.

Setup K3s Cluster
-----------------

Before starting, install `kubectl` has been installed on client system

To build your cluster:

#. select the nodes for installation and apply the `k3s-install` workflow
#. wait for workflow to complete on leader
#. use `drpcli profiles get cluster01 param k3s/admin-conf --decode > admin.conf`

To access on the DRP server or cluster:

#. test with `kubectl --kubeconfig=admin.conf get nodes`

To access from another system, use an SSH tunnel:

#. setup an ssh tunnel: `ssh root@[host wifi ip] -L 6443:[leader node ip]:6443`
#. modify your `admin.conf` file to use `127.0.0.1` instead of the leader node ip
#. test with `kubectl --kubeconfig=admin.conf get nodes`


Machine Reset
-------------

Setting a machine's workflow to `edge-lab-reboot-to-discover` will force the machine through a soft reboot process and back to discovery.

To indicate that the machine has been rebooted, the icon is set to the red recycling image.  The icon will remain until it get's reset.

The machine is avilable once it is marked Runnable again.


Edge Lab Bootstrap
------------------

This content pack includes the steps needed to bootstrap the Edge Lab server.  This includes
a workflow, stage, and tasks to:

#. Download the required isos (sledgehammer rpi, but others as well).
#. Set the default preferences to make Edge Lab work.
#. Set up an ssh key pair if one does not exist and update the global profile with it.
   This can be used to access the clients from the server.
#. Create the default subnet for the Edge Lab.
#. Lock the Machine to prevent unintented actions

The start_me.sh script will install the edge-lab content pack and set the DRP server's workflow to the bootstrap
workflow.  The status of bootstrapping can be tracked in the jobs for the DRP server.
