  Mount Attached Storage
  ++++++++++++++++++++++

  Ordered list of of devices to attempt mounting from the OS.

  The EdgeLab K3s install will attempt to mount all the drives
  in the list in in order.  If the desired mount point is already
  in use then the code will skip attempting to assign it.

  This design allows operators to specific multiple mount points
  or have a single point with multiple potential configurations.

  example:

    ::

      [
        {
          disk: "/dev/mmcblk0",
          partition: "/dev/mmcblkp1",
          mount: "/mnt/storage",
          type: "xfs",
          rebuild: true,
          comment: "example"
        }
        {
          disk: "/dev/sda",
          partition: "/dev/sda1",
          mount: "/mnt/storage",
          type: "xfs",
          rebuild: true,
          comment: "put something here"
        }
      ]
