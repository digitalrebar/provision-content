Description: "Set GPIO pins for SQUID"
Documentation: |
  If a SQUID LED is attached to the RPi, this will turn on different colors.
  It is very helpful for validating workflows during development

  You can supply an array with specific number of the GPIO pins to set.

  Three pin mappings to colors have been pre-wired:

  * 18 = red
  * 23 = green
  * 24 = blue
