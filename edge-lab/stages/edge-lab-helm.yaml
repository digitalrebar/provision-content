Description: "Edge Lab install helm and run charts"
Documentation: |
  Installs and runs Helm Charts after a cluster has been constructed.
  This stage is idempotent and can be run multiple times.
  This allows operators to create workflows with multiple instances of this stage.
  The charts to run are determined by the edge-lab/helm-charts parameter.

  Unless helm is uploaded to file helm/helm, this stage requires internet access.
