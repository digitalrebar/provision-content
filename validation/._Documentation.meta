Validation System
-----------------

The Validation System allows an operator to flexibly define a set of
tasks to do validation operations.  Validation allows an operator to
execute tests to verify that certain conditions have been met either
in the environment or as completed tasks by other workflow steps.
This allows for a composable set of rules to be run to either verify
the system has been provisioned successfully or an error may have
occured that needs addressed.

The validation system is designed to be flexibly extended in the field.  The
current set of Staes, Library functions, and Tasks are curated capabilities
by RackN. Custom Stages and Tasks can be flexibly added to allow for
unique use cases.

If you have developed a set of Tasks and Library functions that may be
useful to other operators, please consider contributing back to the content
pack to enhance it for other users.


Prebuilt Stages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The validation system provides three prebuilt base sets of validation
stages to run the validation engine in:

  1. ``validation-post-discover``
  2. ``validation-post-hardware``
  3. ``validation-post-install``

The intent is to have a set of tasks that validate after the initial
discover (*gohai-inventory*, *inventory*, or other "discover" related tasks),
post hardware configuration (typically after BIOS settings, Firmware Flash,
and RAID volume creation), and in the final installed operating system.

The validation system is run in Workflow as a standard *Stage* allowing the
operator to place the stage anywhere in the Workflow that makes sense.  The
above three pre-built stages define RackN defined useful points during the
provisioning lifecycle of a _Machine_.

The ``validation-start`` and ``validation-stop`` tasks are the only tasks
that should be listed in the Stage, do not add Tasks to the Stage.  Tasks
will dynamically be added based on the control Paramters.


Defining Validation Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Control over which specific validation tasks are executed at any given
validation stage is defined by the Param ``validation/list-parameter``.
This parameter is a reference to the Param name that the ``validation-start``
task uses to dynamically update the task list with a list of validation tasks.

The Tasks that are defined in the parameter (specified by the
``validation/list-parameter``) will be composed and added to the task list.
These will be dynamically inserted between the ``validation-start`` and
``validation-stop`` tasks.

*Composed* means the value of that parameter is the aggregation of all
occurances of that parameter at all levels of the system, (e.g. From
the parameters on the machine, then profiles on machines, then parameters
on the stage, ...).  This allows multiple resources to provide the validation
tests that will eventually be run on the system.  Typically, Parameter orders
of precedence would override earlier occurances of the Paramter values.
Validation does not follow that standard path.

The Param that is referenced by ``validation/list-parameter`` should be a
simple array type Param.  It lists each *Task* that should be executed in
the listed sequence by the validation process at that *Stage* in the
*Workflow*.


Task Exit Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Validation actions can exit one of three ways:

  1. fatal: immediately stops execution
  2. fail: continue remaining validations, failures tallied at the end
  3. succeed: mark validation successful and continue

Each validation task should do one of the following:

  * *success* - Return 0
  * *failure* - Return 0, and Update the ``validation/errors`` Param
  * *fatal* - Return 1

The concept is that *Success* returns zero and processing continues as normal.

*Failure* logs the failure in the ``validation/errors`` logging parameter
on the machine, but still returns 0 to allow continuation of testing any
remaining validation tasks on the task list.  If any single failure occurs,
then when the ``validation-stop`` stage is reached, the Workflow will be
stopped.

*Fatal* does NOT update the ``validation/errors`` parameter, but does return 1,
which immediately halts the Workflow system.  An operator may potentially be
able to remediate the issue, and then restart the *Runner* to continue the
Workflow processing.


Remediating and Continuing Failed Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two failure exit conditions allow the developer of the validation task
to determine if the failure is a "soft" failure which can be remediated, and
then the Workflow can be resumed, or if the failure implies a "hard" fail
that can not be corrected during workflow operation.

If a failure that is external to machine and can be remediated (for example a
DNS record has the wrong information, and DNS can be updated quickly)
the test should be *fatal*.  This allows the failure to be remediate and Workflow
can be continued without failing validation.

If the failure is not able to be remediated immediately, a log message should be
added to the ``validation/errors`` logging Param, and success returned so
that additional issues can be found and aggregated.


Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a brief outline of example usage of the validation system utilizing
the RackN defined stages.  In this example, we will define tasks to run in
the ``validation-post-discovery`` and ``validation-post-hardware`` stages.
Most of the Tasks referenced are valid tasks that exist across several
content and plugin components.

Workflow
========

In this example we will create a "my-complete-discovery" workflow that utilizes several
components of the Digital Rebar content and plugins capabity.

.. note::  Note the addition of the 'validation-post-discovery' and
  'validation-post-hardware' Stages, these define the point in the workflow
   where the validation process will run.

	::

		Meta:
  		color: grey
  		icon: money
		Name: my-complete-discovery
		Description: My complete discovery workflow
		Stages:
			- discover
			- setup-repos
			- ipmi-inventory
			- raid-inventory
			- network-lldp
			- inventory
			- rack-discover
			- classify
			- validation-post-discover
			- ipmi-configure
			- flash
			- raid-enable-encryption
			- raid-configure
			- bios-configure
			- ilo-config
			- burnin
			- burnin-reboot
			- validation-post-hardware
			- notify-hardware-complete
			- sledgehammer-wait


Stages
======

In this example, we are not creating any new stages, simply using the RackN
defined stages in the above workflow example.  Please review the "*Adding
New Stages*" section in the below "*Developing New Validation Capabilities*"
section if you'd like to create custom stages.


Tasks
=====

There are several tasks that are defeind to be used by the Validation system
in this example.  You can find them in the following profile section.  Note
that several of these tasks do exist in various content and plugins.  Each of
these tasks would need to exist and perform the required functions.


Define the Tasks for Validation
===============================

In this example, we will utilize a profile which contains the defined Params
for the ``validation-post-discover`` and ``validation-post-hardware`` stages.
The operator can apply the Profile to the appropriate machines, you could
potentially use the ``classify`` stage to execute a classification task to
determine whether or not to programmatically apply the Profile to the given
machine as it executes the ``classify`` stage.

The profile defines the tasks to run.  The profile YAML configuration would
look like the following:

	::

		---
		Meta:
  		color: grey
  		icon: money
		Name: validations
		Params:
  		validation/post-discover:
    		- "validation-machine-name-dns-to-ip"
    		- "in-subnet-check-render"
    		- "in-subnet-check-validate"
    		- "ipmi-network-validation"
    		- "validate-nic-counts"
    		- "validate-jumbo-frames"
  		validation/post-hardware:
    		- "validate-ipmi-hostname-ip"

The type definition for the Params ``validation/post-discover`` are defined
in the Validation content pack, and the appropriate stage contains the
control mapping for each.

For the ``validation-post-discover`` Stage, the stage carries the mapping
within the stage, as follows:

  ::

    Params:
      "validation/list-parameter": "validation/post-discover"

Similarly, the ``validation-post-hardware`` stage defines the mapping to
point to the Param ``validation/post-discover``.

These are the values we use in our profile above to add the list of Tasks
to execute at the appropriate Stage run.


Operating The Validation
========================

Once you have completed the above tasks, you can choose to make the
``my-complete-discovery`` Workflow your default preference setting for all
new machines, or manually choose to place machines in to the Workflow.

To make this the default workflow, change your preferences (from **Info &
Preferencess** in the Portal), or the following CLI command:

  * ``drpcli prefs set defaultWorkflow my-complete-discovery``


Reviewing Any Failures
======================

As with all jobs executed in Workflows, there will be a job log available to
review the status output of any tasks that have run.  If you receive a
Validation failure, refer to the appropriate job log.

If the failure includes the use of the ``add_validation_error`` function, you
can review the Param value that was added to the Machine, with the name
``validation/errors``.  The Param will be added to the machine that has
failed the validation process.

The next run of any validation stage will empty the contents of this Param,
prior to starting executing the tasks.  Please insure that you review the
Para error values after a failure, but before you re-run any more validation
stages.

It is required to include the ``{{ template "setup.tmpl" .}}`` in each of the
validation tasks.  With the inclusion of this template, you can set the
``rs-debug-param`` on a Machine, and the validation tasks will contain a lot
more debug output in the job log.  If you need to verify/debug the actions in
the validation task, this is a good way to review more detailed output logging
information.


Skipping Validation Without Changing Your Workflow
==================================================

The validation system was designed to allow you to add it to the Workflow, and
if no validation tasks are defined (by use of the reference
``validation/list-parameter`` Param), then the system will skip any validation
attempts for the given stage.

This allows you to leave the Stage defined control parameter blank and
not require changing the Workflow.  This effectively becomes a "noop" of the
validation system.


Developing New Validation Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides information on how to build custom validation capabilities
utilizing the existing Validation system.


Namespace Definitions
=====================

Validation system stages, control params, and other content parts will utilize
the prefix namespace of ``validation/``.  Individual Tasks, Params, etc. that
implement functional use of the Validation system components will utilize the
prefix namespace of ``validate/`.

For example, the Start Stage for the Validation system is ``validation-start``,
while the NIC Count and UP link state checking uses a Task namespaced as
  ``validate-nic-counts`.

Standard Stage/Task and Param semantics still apply (eg ``validate/nic-required-up``
is the Param namespace name).

Note that traditionally, RackN uses the "slash" naming standard for Params,
while Stages, Taks, and Templates generally utilize a "dash" to separate the
parent namespace.  Don't ask us why.


Library of Functions
====================

The Validation System provides a template which contains a library of currated
tools for the system; the template is called *validation-lib.tmpl*.  Only Bash
functions which implement broadly useful capabilities are placed in this
template, which is managed by RackN.

If your validation tools require a common library, they can be built as a
standard template, and included in any appropriate custom tasks.


Adding New Stages
=================

Stages define the primary grouping of Tasks that an operator runs at a given
point in the Workflow sequence.  These stages can be placed anywhere that
makes operational sense to a given Workflow.

The Stage should **only** contain the ``validation-start`` and ``validation-stop``
tasks, no other tasks should be added to your stage, as the ``validation-start``
stage will dynamically inject the desired stages in to the Workflow for the
operator.

Example Stage in YAML:

  ::

    ---
		Name: "my-validation"
		Description: "Perform tasks defined by the 'my-validation' Param."
		Documentation: |
			The Param 'my-validatin' is an array that will contain
			the list of validation tasks to run.
		Params:
  		"validation/list-parameter": "my-validation"
		Tasks:
  		- "validation-start"
  		- "validation-stop"
		Meta:
  		color: "orange"
  		icon: "search"
  		title: "RackN Content"

Note that as the ``Documentation`` field says; the ``validation/list-parameter``
for this Stage is defined as ``my-validation``.  This Parameter must be defined
as an array; which is a list of the Tasks to execute during this Stage.  The
Param can be defined on the Machine in all of the normal ways (directly as a
Param, as part of a Profile, or as a Param in the Global Profile.


Adding New Tasks
================

Tasks are the heart of the validation system, and perform the actual validation
implementation for the system to execute.  Validation tasks are standard RackN
Workflow Tasks, and can carry embedded templates, or refer to external templates
to perform the actual Task(s) defined.

A validation task should include both the ``setup.tmpl`` template and the
``validation-lib.tmpl`` template.  Both templates are required for a successful
validation task.

Validation tasks are only limited by the requirements (and perhaps creativity) of
the author.  They should be individual and discreet items that the system should
check for and return results on.  Please review the "*Task Exit Conditions*" above
to insure you handle exit codes correctly for the system.

Here is an example Task that implements a hypothetical validation function.

	::

		---
		Name: "validation-test-fail"
		Description: "Example failing validation task"
		Meta:
  		color: "blue"
  		icon: "bug"
  		title: "RackN Content"
  		feature-flags: "sane-exit-codes"
		Templates:
		- Name: "validation_fail.sh"
  		Contents: |
    		#!/usr/bin/env bash
    		{{ template "setup.tmpl" . }}
    		{{ template "validation-lib.tmpl" . }}

				{{ if eq (.Param "margarita-time" ) true }}
    			echo "This is a failure.  Calling add_validation_error"
    			add_validation_error "Margarita time! We'll finish provisioning later."
    			exit 0
				{{ else -}}
					echo "Sadly, it's not margarita time.  Provision on!"
					exit 0
				{{ end -}}

In this example, some other component or process would be responsible for
setting the check Param ``margarita-time`` to either ``true`` or ``false``.


Utilizing the Error Logging Param
=================================

The library also contains a helper routine to add errors to the
 ``validation/errors`` logging Param.  The Bash function name is
 ``add_validation_error`` which should be called with a single string which
 contains the text of the error message.  This function can safely called
 multiple times, and each subsequent error message will be appended to the
 ``validatin/errors` array.


Separating Validate Tasks from the Validation System
====================================================

Validation tasks or extensions can be built and used and added to other Content Packs
or Plugins.  The validation system itself is a framework for executing and providing
the method to run and manage the validation process.

Examples of validation in use can be found throughout some of the other RackN
managed content and plugin systems.  For example, review the VMware Plugin content:

  https://github.com/digitalrebar/provision-plugins/blob/v4/cmds/vmware/content/tasks/validation-machine-name-dns-to-ip.yaml

For a validation task that is defined and used outside of the Validation content pack.
