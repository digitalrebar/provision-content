Name: "validation-clear-errors-ignore"
Description: "Resets the 'validation/errors-ignore' log Param to an empty value."
Documentation: |
  This task resets the ``validation/errors-ignore`` contents to an empty value.

  The ``validation/errors-ignore`` Param is not reset at the beginning of each
  Stage run with the ``validation-start`` task.  It is assumed that the operator
  would like to harvest the validation failure log messages, but not have them
  as regularly reset.

  The ignored error messages will be prefixed with the Stage, Task, and Current
  Job UUID so they may be correctly correlated at a later time.

  To use this Task, simply add it to the control Param task list whereever the
  operator would like the Machines Param cleared.  It might make sense to add it
  as the very first Task in the first Validation Stage in a given Workflow.
