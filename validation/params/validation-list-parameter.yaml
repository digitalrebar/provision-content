Name: "validation/list-parameter"
Description: "The name of the parameter that contains the list of test to run"
Documentation: |
  This defines the parameter that the Validation stage currently executing
  will use to reference the list of Tasks to execute for validation. It
  essentially operates as a "control pointer" to the real list, allowing
  for flexible usage of a single defined Param to point to a variable list
  of tasks.
