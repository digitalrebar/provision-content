Name: "validate/parameters"
Description: "Tests to apply to parameters."
Documentation: |
  This param defines the map of parameters to tests to run against them.

  The elements of the map convert a parameter to a test.

  The test structure is an operation and a list of values.

  Example:

  inventory/CPUs:
    Op: equal
    Values: [ 1 ]

  If inventory/CPUs exists and equals the value 1, this is successful.  Otherwise it is a failure.

  Operations:
  * equal - if any one value equals, then it returns true.
  * between - if the value is between the two values.  Values is a list of two values.
  * match - if the value matches the regex value.
