Name: "validate/failure-mode"
Description: "This param specifies how certain Validation tasks should ultimately fail."
Documentation: |
  Set this param to the name of a validation failure function to specify
  how certain validation tasks are recorded, which will impact the final
  exit and continued task running.

  Examples:

    * validation_add_error (default value)
    * validation_add_error_ignore

  This Param is a free-form String type, as the Validation functions can
  be dynamically expanded, so an Enum list can not be safely provided.  Ensure
  you specify a validation failure mode correctly in this param.

  This Param should only be set to a value of a Function in the validation
  system that records the errors, but does not directly exit (eg no ``exit 0``
  or ``exit 1`` type exit codes in the function).

  The default will be to ``validation_add_error``.

  For instance, if this Param is set to ``validation_add_error_ignore``, then
  errors will be recorded on the ``validation/errors-ignore`` Param.  This
  Param defines the ``validation-stop`` processing should not exit with an
  error (eg *ignore*) the errors and continue workflow/task processing.
