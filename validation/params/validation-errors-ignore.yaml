Name: "validation/errors-ignore"
Description: "A list of errors that were ignored in the validationion."
Documentation: |
  If validation occured, and an error is going to be ignored, this Param
  captures that information for further review.

  This Param will not be automatically cleaned up on ``validation-start`` task
  run the way that ``validation/errors`` is.  Instead, the logged ``<message>``
  will be prepended automatically with:

    ::

      Stage Name :: Task Name :: Job UUID :: <message>

  If the operator wishes to wipe this value, add the ``validation-clear-errors-ignore``
  task to the list of tasks to run, and the Param will be reset to an empty value at
  that point in the Workflow/Stage/Task.

Schema:
  type: "array"
