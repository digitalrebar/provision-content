Name: image-builder/upload-manifest-name
Description: "The remote filename for the Manifest of the image build."
Documentation: |
  The final remote filename of the Manifest that is generated by the
  image-builder.  This can utilize built in shell variables for building
  up a unique name.  The only supported shell variables that are supported
  are:

    * ``$TAG`` = The OS Name as defined in the BootEnv structure of the built image
    * ``$DSTAMP`` = The Date Stamp from ``date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S``
    * ``RS_IMAGE_IDENT`` = a uniquely generated ID with 10 character length (generated with ``uuidgen`` and ``md5sum``)

  The name should not contain any filename extension, as a ``.txt`` will be
  automatically added.  If the passed in value contains ``.txt``, it will
  be ignored/preserved.  If a filename extension *other than* ``.txt`` is
  provided in this Param, ``.txt`` will still be appended to the final product.

  The default value utilizes all of the optional shell variables that are supported
  and looks like:

    * ``$TAG-MANIFEST-$DSTAMP-$RS_IMAGE_IDENT``

  .. note:: "MANIFEST" is just upper case and not intended to be a shell
            variable in this example.

  This will ultimately produce an uploaded file with the following format:

    * ``centos-8-MANIFEST-20201105-233755-53fcfe709c.txt``
