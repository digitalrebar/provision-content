Name: image-builder/skip-package-reset
Description: Allows skipping the internal image-builder package-reset path if set to 'true'
Documentation: |
  A boolean value that allows the operator to skip the built in image-builder
  package repository reset task.  By default image-builder will reset packages
  to the distro defaults.  If the operator is using the ``package-repositories``
  feature, this will cause the defined repos to be wiped out.

  The default value for this is ``false``.  To skip repo reset, set this Param
  on the machine, a profile on the machine, or the global profile to ``true``.
