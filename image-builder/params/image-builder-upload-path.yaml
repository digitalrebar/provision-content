Description: "The remote path on the DRP Endpoint File server to upload the RootFS image to."
Documentation: |
  The remote path on the DRP Endpoint Files server, to upload the RootFS
  image to.  By default, the image will be uploaded to the ``images/``
  path, which would make it accessible at:

    * ``https://DRP:8092/files/images/IMAGE``
    * or ``http://DRP:8091/files/images/IMAGE``

  Replacing *DRP* with the name or IP address of the DRP Endpoint, and *IMAGE*
  with the upload image name.

  .. note:: This path is relative to the ``files/`` base path, and must not
            contain any preceding slash ("/").  If it ends with a trailing
            slash, it will be processed accordingly.
