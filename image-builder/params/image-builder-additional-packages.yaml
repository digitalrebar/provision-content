Name: image-builder/additional-packages
Description: An array list of extra packages to install in to the image.
Documentation: |
  During image deployment via the ``image-deploy`` plugin, several actions are
  required to prepare the system appropriately.  This Param defines a list of
  packages that are generally needed to ensure successful image deployment

  Changing this list may make the deployed image faile; depending on the
  requrested fileystem structures (``curtin/partitions``), or hardware boot
  modes (Legacy -vs- UEFI), etc.

  If the operator intends to add to this list, the entire list will need to be
  re-iterated with the *defaults* plus the additionally required packages.
