Name: image-builder/additional-excludes
Description: An array list of files and directories to be excluded from the final tarbal image.
Documentation: |
  An array of strings, of files and/or directories to exclude from the
  tar operation in the final image contents.  These values are passed in as
  exclude patterns, according to the ``tar`` regex processing rules.  Note
  that these files/directories are **not** removed from the original image
  built system, they are simply excluded from being rolled up in the tar.

  Regex wildcards can be used, however, they are limited to shell glob
  patterns as used by ``tar``.

  The default values specified here should not be removed unless the operator
  is certain they need to be in place during the image deployment process.

  .. note:: The ``tar`` operations utilize a relative directory structure, rooted
            in the root filesystem (``/``).  Adjust the file/directory paths
            appropriately!! (eg ``./etc/default/grub``, as opposed to ``/etc/default/grub``).
