Name: image-builder-linux
Description: Create an image ready to be managed by cloud-init
Documentation: |
  An example stage that configures a CentOS 7 host to be ready for Image
  Builder to capture a root filesystem tarball image of the installed system.

  Note that package repository handling may need to be changed for your
  environment, in which case you will want to construct a custom Stage
  that modifies repos correctly for your use.

  In addition this Stage will update all packages to the "latest" in the package
  repositories.  This may not be the correct behavior for your use case.

  This stage performs the following functions:

    1. Reset package repositories - reset package repos to system "stock"
    2. Update all packages to the latest versions in the package repositories
    3. Install ``cloud-init`` for image bootstrap configuration
    4. Clean up the image by stripping out useless kernels, package meta files, etc.
    5. Perform the root filesystem tarball capture and stage it to the DRP Endpoint for use
