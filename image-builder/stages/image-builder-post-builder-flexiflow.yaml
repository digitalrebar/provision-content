Name: image-builder-post-builder-flexiflow
Description: Utilizes flexiflow to expand the image-builder content dynamically.
Documentation: |
  This stage utilizes the Flexiflow content pack to allow image builds that
  can dynamically inject new tasks to customize the OS/image before cleanup.

  To utilize this, please review the Flexiflow content for more complete details.
  Basic usage:

    * set the Param ``image-builder/post-builder-flexiflow`` as an Array of tasks to inject in place of this stage

  Example:

    ::

      image-builder/post-builder-flexiflow:
        - additional-cleanup

  In our theoretical example above, we have 1 task.  This task is run after the
  ``image-builder-cleanup`` task, but before the image is captured.  It allows
  the operator to inject additional tasks post-cleanup for any additional
  preparation of the image just prior to capturing the image.
