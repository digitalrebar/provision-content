Name: image-capture
Description: A task to run the Image Builder image capture.
Documentation: |
  The ``image-capture`` task brands the image with detail information to properly
  identify the built image version, temestamps, etc.  The root filesystem will be
  rolled up in to a Tar and GZip formatted archive (TGZ).

  Last, the image will be uploaded to the DRP Endpoint in the HTTP/S **Files** file
  server space for subsequent download and use by the ``image-deploy`` plugin.

  This task requires the **ExtraClaims** capability for the ``files`` scope to be
  able to authorize the Files upload.  Older versions of this content required a
  Param defined set of Username/Password values to access the DRP Endpoint files
  upload capability.
