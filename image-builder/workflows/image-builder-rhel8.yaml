Description: RHEL Server 8 Image Builder Workflow
Documentation: |
  This example workflow starts a RHEL 8 Image Builder "gold image" build
  and capture process.

  To create a customized version of the image for your use case, use the
  folowing stages to dynamically inject customization tasks in to this
  workflow:

    * ``image-builder-pre-builder-flexiflow`` - runs before ``image-builder-linux`` stage
    * ``image-builder-post-builder-flexiflow`` - runs after ``image-builder-linux`` stage

  See each of the stages for documentation on how to use them.

  RHEL requires special handling to work due to how Redhat manages subscriptions.
  You may need to set the following Params:

    ::

      image-builder/skip-package-reset: true
      redhat/subscription-username: "[Insert RHSM Username]"
      redhat/subscription-password: "[Insert RHSM Password]"
      redhat/rhsm-activation-key: "[Insert RHSP Activation Key]"
      redhat/rhsm-organization: "[Insert RHSM Organization ID]"
      redhat/subscription-repos:
        - rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
        - rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
        - rhel-8-for-x86_64-supplementary-rpms

  Note that the Subscription Repos must be set as the default values will not work
  for RHEL 8.  The above three are known to work, but others may be added if needed.
  See the Param for more documentation on options.

  There are other ``redhat/rhsm-*`` related Params that you may need in your environment.
  Consult the list of Params for more configuration options.
