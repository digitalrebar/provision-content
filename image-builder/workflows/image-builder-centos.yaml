Description: CentOS Image Builder Workflow
Documentation: |
  This example workflow starts a CentOS Image Builder "gold image" build
  and capture process.

  To create a customized version of the image for your use case, you may
  want to clone this workflow and add stages between the ``centos-7-install``
  and ``image-builder-linux`` stages.  Any stage between those two will be
  operating on the *chroot* root filesystem of the image that is built.  Changes
  will be part of your image.
