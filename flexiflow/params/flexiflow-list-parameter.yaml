Name: "flexiflow/list-parameter"
Description: "The name of the parameter that contains the Param name with has the list of tasks to run."
Documentation: |
  This defines the parameter that the ``flexiflow-stage`` stage
  will use to reference the list of Tasks to dynamically execute. It
  essentially operates as a "control pointer" to the real list, allowing
  for flexible usage of a single defined Param to point to a variable list
  of tasks.

  The Param that it points to **must be** type defined in the system, and
  it must be an Array of Strings.

Schema:
  type: "string"
Meta:
  color: "purple"
  icon: "magic"
  title: "RackN Content"
