Description: "Provides flexibly injected list of tasks to run during this stage."
Documentation: |
  This Stage implements the FlexiFlow capability.  When the task ``flexiflow-start``
  is run, it will reference the paramtger defined in the ``flexiflow/list-parameter``
  Param.  The Param that is referenced must be defined as an Array of Strings. Each
  array element must be an existing Task on the system.  The list of tasks will
  be dynamically injected in to this stage and run.

  **Do not** insert any tasks between the start and stop tasks.

  This task **requires** that the Param ``flexiflow/list-parameter`` exists on the
  machine to run successfully.

  - "flexiflow/list-parameter"
