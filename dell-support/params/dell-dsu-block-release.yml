Name: dell-dsu-block-release
Description: The block release to pull firmware and OMSA from.  Defaults to the latest block release.
Documentation: |
  Dell releases updates to its firmware on a block schedule (usually
  once a month) and the tooling assumes that all firmware in a block
  should be installed together.  You can use this param to pin
  firmware and tools at a specific release, or you can leave it
  unspecified to allow tools and updates to be installed from the
  latest block release.

  Block releases are named according to the following format:

    * ``YY.MM.NN``

  Where:

    * ``YY`` is the last two digits of the year
    * ``MM`` is the month
    * ``NN`` is the nth release in a month, starting at 00

  An example value:

    * ``20.08.01``

  Block release versions can be found at:

    * https://linux.dell.com/repo/hardware/

  .. note:: The repo mirror directories contain the prefix ``DSU_`` in front
            of the BlocK Release number.  This will be automatically added,
            if not specified in the ``dell-dsu-block-release`` Param value.
