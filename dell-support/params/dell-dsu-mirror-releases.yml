Name: dell-dsu-mirror-releases
Description: The DSU Block Releases to mirror locally.
Documentation: |
  The Dell System Update (DSU) block releases that should be mirrored
  to the local target Machines filesystem.

  Mirrors based on the ``dell-dsu-base-url`` Param setting, which defaults to
  ``http://linux.dell.com/repo/hardware/dsu``.

  If no values are set, only the most current DSU Block Release will be mirrored.

  The ``dell-dsu-skip-dsu`` Param if set to ``true`` will override, and skip
  mirroring the DSU Block Releases.  Only PGP Keys will be mirrored in that case.

Schema:
  type: "array"
  items:
    type: "string"
  default: []
