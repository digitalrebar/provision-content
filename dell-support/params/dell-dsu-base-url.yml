Name: dell-dsu-base-url
Description: The base URL that the Dell System Update yum repos live at.
Documentation: |
  The Dell System Update (DSU) repositories contain BIOS and firmware
  updates for all supported Dell servers (in the ``os_independent`` repo)
  as well as OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) (in the ``os_dependent`` repo).

  You can find more information on DSU and the update process we take advantage of
  at https://linux.dell.com/repo/hardware/dsu/

  If the the firmware or BIOS components are mirrored, you can specify that
  location; however, the mirror structures must match the Dell repository
  layout.

  If the Param ``dell-dsu-block-release`` is not set, then the Base URL will
  be used directly.  If a specific block release is defined, then the trailing
  ``/dsu`` path part will be trimmed, and if not already specified, the block
  release version will be prefixed with ``DSU_``.

  This results in the following example scenarios:

    * ``dell-dsu-block-release = ""`` = ``http://linux.dell.com/repo/hardware/dsu``
    * ``dell-dsu-block-release = "20.08.01"`` = ``http://linux.dell.com/repo/hardware/DSU_20.08.01``
    * ``dell-dsu-block-release = "DSU_19.09.01"`` = ``http://linux.dell.com/repo/hardware/DSU_19.08.01``

Schema:
  type: string
  default: http://linux.dell.com/repo/hardware/dsu
