Description: "Whether to zero entire hard disks when erasing before install"
Documentation: |
  By default, the erase disks for os install task tries to only erase
  any metadata on the disks that may confuse a next OS install, along with
  (optionally) attempting to discard all sectors on devices that support
  discard.  If this is set to true, the task will also zero all sectors
  on any non-SSD drives.
