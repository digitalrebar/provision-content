Name: "provisioner-default-password-hash"
Description: "Defines the password of the default user in hash form"
Documentation: |
  This specifies the password hash to use for the install process.  This is the
  root password on CentOS-based installs, the default user on the Debian-based
  installs, and the root password for ESXi.  Any other system that utilizes a
  SHA512 type hashed password can use this.

  To generate a hash, use the following command:

    ::

      # where "PASSWORD" is the new password to generate the hash for
      python3 -c "import crypt; print(crypt.crypt(\"PASSWORD\", crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))"

  This will generate a sha512 hash which should work on both operating system types.
