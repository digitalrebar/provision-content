Name: "network-data-output-type"
Description: "Defines what variable output type for 'network-data-parser.tmpl' template."
Documentation: |
  The template ``network-data-parser.tmpl`` parses the ``network-data`` structure in a
  consistent manner and set of rules.  To reuse the parsing rules, include the template
  in to other templates.  Since golang templating can't pass variables from an
  included template in to the scope of the operating template, we must rely on the
  scripted language Varaible definitions.

  Setting this Param to one of the supported types, will tell the ``network-data-parser.tmpl``
  to generate the correct Variable references for the targeted scripting language.
  Supported scripted languages are:

    * ``shell`` = Shell (BASH, SH, ZSH, etc)
    * ``powershell`` = PowerShell
    * ``python`` = Python (2 and 3 compatible)

  The default value if not otherwise specified is ``shell`` (BASH, SH, etc).

Schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - shell
    - powershell
    - python
  default: shell
Meta:
  type: "value"
  icon: "file alternate outline"
  color: "green"
