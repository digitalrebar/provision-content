Name: "workflow/escape"
Description: "Seconds to pause, then break workflows in process (embedded in setup.tmpl)"
Documentation: |
  Allows operators to interrupt workflows from a global, profile or machine
  basis by overriding this one param.  Requires that the workflow task(s) use
  the setup.tmpl.

  By default, value of -1 is ignored an workflow is not interrupted.

  If value is 0 then task will `exit 1` out of the task and stop the workflow.

  If value is >0 then the task will sleep 1 second and the value will decremented
  and stored on the machine running the task.  

  Values >0 allow operators to specify a pause before the workflow is halted.
  If the workflow/escape param is removed from the machine before it reaches 0
  then the task can continue without interruption.   This allows for operators
  to choose between fast fail (workflow/escape = 0) or delayed fail ater X Seconds
  (workflow/escape > 0).

  If the machine's param value is removed before the value reaches 0 then the
  workflow will continue without interruption.

  NOTE: if you set the workflow/escape value on a machine to -1 then it
  will disable the ability to override at a higher level.
