Name: kexec-ok
Description: "Allows the machine agent to kexec instead of rebooting"
Documentation: |
  Allows the machine agent to call kexec to switch boot environments
  as long as the machine is currently running Linux, and the new
  environment has a template named 'kexec' that contains the
  kernel, initrds, and command line to use. This can be used to speed
  up deployments of systems that support kexec.

  .. note:: Not all Linux kernels/distros ship with kexec support enabled. Check your distro for compatibility.
