Description: The python to use when a script asks for '/usr/bin/python'
Documentation: |
  This param can be set to one of three different values:
  
  1. `auto`, which will remove /the /usr/bin/python link.
     When auto is in use, your Python scripts will need to
     explicitly choose which python interpreter to use, either
     via the #! line at the start of the script or via more
     ornate means.
     
  2. `/usr/bin/python2`, which will point `/usr/bin/python` to python2
     
  3. `/usr/bin/python`, which will point `/usr/bin/python` to python3
Schema:
  type: string
  default: /usr/bin/python2
  enum:
    - auto
    - /usr/bin/python2
    - /usr/bin/python3
