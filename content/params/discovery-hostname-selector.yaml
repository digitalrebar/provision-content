Name: "discovery-hostname-selector"
Description: "Sets the Discovery BootEnv default hostname selection method."
Documentation: |
  This param sets the Discovery BootEnv (typically used to discover and
  create new machine objects when a Machine is Unknown to DRP) mechanism
  for assigning a machine hostname.

  The configurable values are:

    * ``reverse-dns`` (the default): Attempt a Reverse IP lookup of the Machines assigned IP address, and use that
    * ``d-mac`` use the MAC address in the form ``d00-00-00-12-34-56``
    * ``external-template``: allow operator to provide custom template to assign hostname
    * ``random``: Generates an 8 character random string for the hostname

  In all cases, if the selected mechanism fails, then the fall-through default
  behavior of using the *dMAC* process (eg. ``d00-00-00-12-34-56``) will be
  used.  This allows Discovery to complete successfully.

  For the ``external-template`` method, please review the Documentation
  of the ``discovery-hostname-template`` Param on how to correctly use it.
  You *MUST* specify an external template on the system to use this value,
  otherwise, the *dMAC* assignment for hostname and Machine object Name
  will be used.

  .. note:: If a hostname is specified in the DHCP lease mechanism, this
            will be honored and take precedence over any settings used
            by this Param.

  .. note:: This param will generally have to be applied at the Global profile level, as the Discovery BootEnv is used to create new
            machine objects for Unknown Machines.
