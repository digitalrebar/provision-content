Name: "part-scheme"
Description: "Defines a string that references a template for partitioning during installation."
Documentation: |
  This string contains the name of a template that holds the OS installer partitioning
  commands for use during installation.

  The string will be expanded into this template name:

    ::

      part-scheme-<string>.tmpl

  e.g. a value of ``softraid`` would expand to the template name ``part-scheme-softraid.tmpl``

  Each Operating System utilizes different format network configuration files
  (eg kickstart, preseed, yaml, or json) types.  The specified partitioning
  scheme must follow the OS installers formatting guidelines.  In particular,
  formatting constraings based on the type must be followed exactly (eg,
  yaml space indentation, json comma separation, etc.).
