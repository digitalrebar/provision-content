  This is a named set of key/value pairs.  All data elements are strings.

  This allows for the create of a named network with additional information
  about the network.  Known supported keys within a network are:

  * name = the name of the network again (same as key)
  * dhcp = yes/no/true/false as a string.  Remember to quote true or false.
  * vlan = VLAN ID number - Remember to quote numbers.
  * mtu = MTU for this network - Remember to quote numbers.
  * gateway = IPv4 Gateway address
  * netmask = IPv4 Netmaks
  * address = IPv4 Address - In some cases, this will NOT be required.  DNS lookups...

  Leave the element out if not needed.

  For example:

    ::

      prov:
        name: prov
        dhcp: yes
      prod:
        name: prod
        dhcp: no
        gateway: 10.2.3.1
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        address: 10.2.3.15
      stor:
        name: stor
        dhcp: no
        gateway: 10.3.3.1
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        address: 10.3.3.15
        vlan: "2335"
