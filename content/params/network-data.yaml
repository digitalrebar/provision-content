Name: "network-data"
Description: "Defines general network information for use across the system."
Documentation: |
  This is a named set of key/value pairs.  All data elements are strings.

  This allows for the create of a named network with additional information
  about the network.  Known supported keys within a network are:

  * name = the name of the network again (same as key)
  * dhcp = yes/no/true/false as a string.  Remember to quote true or false.
  * vlan = VLAN ID number - Remember to quote numbers.
  * mtu = MTU for this network - Remember to quote numbers.
  * gateway = IPv4 Gateway address
  * netmask = IPv4 Netmaks
  * address = IPv4 Address - In some cases, this will NOT be required.  DNS lookups...
  * inteface = a comma separated list of interfaces to used e.g. eth0,enp0s3 - if needed.
  * routes = a list of route objects
  * dns-servers = a list of dns-servers (though generally this is specified with the dns-servers parameter)

  Leave the element out if not needed.

  The `all` network can be used to define things that should apply to all networks.  This is meant for dns-servers
  and routes currently.

  For example:

    ::

      all: # Special non-network to hold global-level things of routes and dns-servers
        routes:
        - network: 20.20.20.0
          gateway: 192.168.2.1
          netmask: 255.255.255.0
          interface: eth1
        dns-servers:
        - 8.8.8.8
        - 8.8.4.4
      prov:
        name: prov
        dhcp: yes
        routes:
        - network: 10.10.10.0
          gateway: 192.168.1.1
          netmask: 255.255.255.0
          interface: eth0
      prod:
        name: prod
        dhcp: no
        gateway: 10.2.3.1
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        address: 10.2.3.15
      stor:
        name: stor
        dhcp: no
        gateway: 10.3.3.1
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        address: 10.3.3.15
        vlan: "2335"
        interface: "eth0,enp0s3"
