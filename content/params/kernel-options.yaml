Name: "kernel-options"
Description: "Defines extra options to pass to the kernel on PXE boot"
Documentation: |
  This string defines any extra options that the operator may need to
  pass to the Kernel during the PXE boot process. The string you enter
  will be directly passed, so if your distro requires comma, or space
  seperation of options define them accordingly.

  e.g. "acpi=off"

  These options will be passed before the argument processing is disabled
  (eg prior to "--").

  The "kernel-console" option can be used to specify the Console to log to
  (for example serial port), which is placed after the argument processing
  (eg after the "--").
