Description: "Allow setting a hostname."
Documentation: |
  Allow setting a hostname.  In some use cases, the DHCP provided
  provisioning name (the templatized `.Machine.Name`) may not be
  correct for final production personality of the Machine.

  This value could be set as a Param/Profile on the machine either
  by a human operator, or subsequent integration with IPAM, SoR, or
  other services.

  This is used in the VMware ESXi provisioning kickstarts.

  To set the hostname of most Linux hosts update the value of
  `.Machine.Name`.
