Description: "Specifies how Debian 10 (buster) configures the Debian Installer network"
Documentation: |
  It appears that in Debian 10 (Buster) - the use of any *preseed* directives to
  configure the network is hard coded to *auto* (DHCP) for single NIC hosts.  Multiple
  NIC hosts will stop and ask the operator what NIC to use for installation.

  This occurs regarldess of any *preseed* directives.  The only apparent way to
  configure Debian 10 interfaces at installation are to pass the *netcfg/...*
  values on the Kernel command line.

  This Param specifies that the network interface should be chosen automatically,
  regardless of the number of NICs in the system; with the default value set to:

    * ``netcfg/choose_interface=auto``

  If you replace *auto* with the name of the Network Interface, then the installer
  will use your explicitly set NIC.

  For static IP assignment or, explicit NIC selection requirements, you will have
  to set this Param on the Machine object, the *preseed* directives are ignored.

  An example to explicitly set a Static IP assignment for the installer is as
  follows:

    * ``netcfg/get_ipaddress=192.168.1.10 netcfg/get_netmask=255.255.255.0 netcfg/get_gateway=192.168.1.1 netcfg/get_nameservers=1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1 netcfg/choose_interface=eth0 netcfg/disable_autoconfig=true``

  type: "string"
  default: "netcfg/choose_interface=auto"
