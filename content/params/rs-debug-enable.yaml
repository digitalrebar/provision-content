Name: "rs-debug-enable"
Description: "Enables bash debugging ('set -x') in the 'setup.tmpl'."
Documentation: |
  Boolean value that enables Bash Script debugging - essentially
  by turning on 'set -x' globally.  Scripts can (and probably do)
  enable/disable this flags in various sections.  In those cases
  we are not overriding those values. 

  Additionally, the shell variable 'RS_DEBUG_ENABLE' is set to 1 (on)
  for Script authors to use.  This allows a construct like

    ::

      (( $RS_DEBUG_ENABLE )) && run_debug_function

Schema:
  type: "boolean"
  default: false
