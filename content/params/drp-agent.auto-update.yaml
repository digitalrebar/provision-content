Name: drp-agent/auto-update
Description: Whether to allow the agent to automatically update itself on startup.
Documentation: |
  When drpcli is starting up in agent mode, it has the capability to
  check in with the provisioner to see if the binary the provisioner
  os providing is different than the one on the local machine.  If
  that is the case, then the agent will download the current version
  and use that, assuming that dr-provision has the `agent-auto-update`
  feature.

  This functionality does not work on Windows due to not being able to
  remove running binaries.  For now.
Schema:
  type: boolean
  default: true
