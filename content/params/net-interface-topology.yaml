Name: net/interface-topology
Description: "Topology of the local interfaces as expressed in netplan format"
Documentation: |
  This parameter defines what the local network interface topology
  on a machine should look like, as expressed in netplan format.
  https://netplan.io/reference defines how this param must be formatted,
  with a few key differences:

  * It only supports systemd-networkd and old-style Redhat network
    configurations as output formats.  Debian style is a planned on,
    and NetworkManager style is a lower priority.

  * No support for configuring wireless interfaces or tunnel devices.
    Wireless support is omitted because this tool is mainly intended
    for servers and other devices that do not have wireless
    interfaces.  Tunnel devices are omitted primarily due to developer
    bandwidth constraints.

  * No support for NIC renaming or MAC address reassignment.  Support
    may be added at a later date.

  * Where ther netplan.io spec calls for glob expansion when matching
    names or device drivers, we also allow full regular expressions,
    as long as the match in question starts with ^.

  * No support for per-interface backend renderers.  This just doesn't
    seem like a good idea if you don't care about dynamic interface
    reconfiguration.

  * Support for a few interesting generic interface match names in the
    netplan:

    - *bootif* is the interface the system last booted from, as
      recorded by the last-boot-macaddr Param.

    - *onboard:1* ... *onboard:n* The first through nth onboard nics.
      Whether a nic is onboard or not is determined by what udev
      thinks.

    - *pci:1* ... *pci:n* The first through nth nic in PCI expansion
      slots.  These nics are always ordered by their PCI bus ordering,
      which can vary on a system by system basis.

    - *usb:1* ... *usb:n* The first through nth USB nics, also ordered
      by bus order.  If you want to use one of these, make sure it
      stays plugged in to the same USB port.

  This param primarily concerns itself with topology, not address
  management, which is handled by the net/interface-config param
  instead.  As such, you should not include any addresses, routes, etc
  in this param.  If you do, they will be overridden by matching
  fields for the matching interface IDs in the net/interface-config
  param.  In netplan terminollogy, this param should contain a match
  stanza for each ID that requires it, along with any device-specific
  properties required for virtual devices ( vlan ID, bridge
  configuration settings, bond modes, etc).

  The default for ths parameter is

    ::

      network:
        version: 2

  which leaves the network topology on the machine alone.  A contrived
  example which bonds the onboard interfaces, bridges that bond with
  all the interfaces on expansion cards, and then creates a VLAN
  interface on top of that is as follows:

    ::

      network:
        version: 2
        ethernets:
          onboards:
            match:
              name: '^onboard:.*'
          others:
            match:
              name: pci:*
        bonds:
          bond0:
            interfaces: [ onboards ]
            parameters:
              mode: '802.3ad'
        bridges:
          bridge0:
            interfaces: [ others, bond0 ]
        vlans:
          vlan0:
            id: 1000
            link: bridge0

  Many other topologies are possible.
