Name: "discovery-hostname-template"
Description: "External template that gets the hostname for Machine."
Documentation: |
  If a system needs a customized way to get the hostname, which is
  subsequently used to initially set the Machine object Name field,
  then set the Param ``discovery-hostname-selector`` to the value of
  ``external-template`` and set this Param to the name of a BASH
  based template that sets the Shell Variable ``HOSTNAME`` to a
  validly formed name.

  This template will be injected inside of a BASH ``case`` statement.
  It must be valid BASH, and ultimately it must set the Shell variable
  ``HOSTNAME`` correctly.

  An example External Template that generates a random 8 character
  string which would be set to the HOSTNAME might look like:

    ::

      # do not use /dev/urandom directly - not enough entropy on VMs
      HOSTNAME=$(pwmake 256 | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z' | fold -w 8 | head -n 1)

  Setting the two Params as described above with a template like this
  has the effect of setting the Discovery/Sledgehammer hostname to
  the random string, and the newly created machine object ``Name``
  field will also be set to this string.

  .. note:: If the ``discovery-hostname-selector`` is set to use
            ``external-template``, but no template is specified in the
            ``discovery-hostname-template`` Param, then the default
            behavior of using the dMAC (eg 'd00-00-00-12-34-56') value
            will be used.  This allows the discovery process to continue
            successfully.

  .. warning:: If the injecte external template produces BASH shell
               errors, the ``start-up.sh`` script will fail, and no new
               Machine object will be created.
