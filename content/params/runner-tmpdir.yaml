Name: runner-tmpdir
Description: The temp directory the runner should keep scratch data in
Documentation: |
  Normally, when the machine agent runs tasks, it uses a hierarchy of
  scratch directories underneath /tmp to hold temporary running data,
  such as job logs, generated scripts, etc.  This param allows you to
  override that default location on a machine-by-machine basis.  On
  Unix systems, it does this by setting the TMPDIR environment
  variable to the value if this parameter when the agent start up.  On
  Windows, it does so by setting the TMP environment variable
  instead.  If this parameter is left unset, then the machine agent
  will use whatever the default values for the system are.
