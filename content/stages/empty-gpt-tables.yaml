Name: "empty-gpt-tables"
Description: |
  For every disk found in the system, write an empty GPT table
  on the disk.  This typically should follow the ``prep-install``
  Stage which wipes the disks clean.

  Useful for disks destined for VMware vSphere VSAN or other storage
  solutions that require starting with a clean disk with an empty
  GPT table to use the disk.
