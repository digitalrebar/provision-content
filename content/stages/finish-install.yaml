Name: "finish-install"
Description: "Stage to indicate that all the install tasks are done and the system should complete the OS install"
Documentation: |
  Originally, this stage was used with the STOP runner action in the change-stage/map.

  Going forward, the STOP action is not required.  The changing of bootenv from something-install to
  local will cause the runner to exit.  This stage will cause an install bootenv to reboot because the
  bootenv is changed to local.

BootEnv: "local"
