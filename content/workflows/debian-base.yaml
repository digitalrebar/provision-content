Description: "[DEPRECATED] Basic Debian Install Workflow + Runner"
Documentation: |
  .. warning:: DEPRECATED - This workflow will be removed from future versions of
               DRP.  Please use the ``universal`` content pack and workflows.  See
               :ref:`deploy_linux_with_universal` and :ref:`rs_release_v46_deprecations`.

  This workflow includes the DRP Runner in Ubuntu provisioning process for DRP.

  This does NOT start a runner service because it creates a dependency loop with
  the task-library.  It should be moved into the task-library, but it is already
  DEPRECATED.  Use the universal-application-debian-10 instead.

  .. note:: To enable, upload the firmware-10 ISO as per the debian-10 BootEnv

Stages:
  - debian-10-install
  - finish-install
  - complete
