Description: "Simplest Sledgehammer Discovery Workflow"
Documentation: |
  This workflow is the most basic provisioning process for DRP.

  It starts the discover Stage which sets up the sledgehammer BootEnv.
  After Sledgehammer starts, it leaves the DRP runner in a waiting
  state so that DRP will automatically detect and start a new workflow
  if the Machine.Workflow is updated.

  NOTE: To enable, upload Sledgehammer as per the sledgehammer BootEnv
Stages:
  - "discover"
  - "sledgehammer-wait"
