# Endpoints is an (optional) comma-separated list of dr-provision

# You must specify at least one endpoint

# Token is the authentication token that the Agent should use.
# It must be a machine-specific token with a lifetime that is
# significantly longer than the expected time between reprovisions
# of this system.  If you are going to generate this config file
# with a template from a task running during OS install (strongly
# recommended), then {{.GenerateInfiniteToken}} will make a suitable
# token, otherwise the following drpcli command will:
#
# drpcli machines token <machine-uuid> --ttl 3y
#
# That will generate a machine token that expires in 3 years.
# The token itself is the base64-encoded string in the Token field
# of the returned JSON object.
#
# You must specify a token

#
# You must specify a machine UUID

# Context is the machine context that this runner should pay attention to.
# When running this agent as the maun agent running tasks for the
# Machine, it should be left blank.

# AllowAutoUpdate allows the agent to try and automatically update itself
