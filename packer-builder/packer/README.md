
This builds various OSes using base Vagrant boxes using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

# Git Get the Packer Builder Content

Requires `git` (to get this repo!).

The Packer only config and content pieces to do the image builds is housed
in the RackN Digital Rebar Provision Content (digitalrebar/provision-content)
Github repo.  To pull only the Packer pieces, you can use Git to get just
the Packer build content with the following:

```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/digitalrebar/provision-content.git
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/v4 -- packer-builder/packer
```

This will produce a populated directory with the Packe build pieces in
`packer-build/packer/` location.  There is also Bash script used in the
Digital Rebar content to perform this task in the `templates`.


# Setup

Run the following two scripts to get Packer, Vagrant, and setup KVM/Qemu:

* `setup-tools.sh` # sets up packer, vagrant, etc.
* `setup-kvm.sh`  # sets up KVM, Qemu, and base tools

`make` is used to initiate the image builds.  Use `make help` for build targets.

# Example

The `do-win10` script is a simplified example to build Windows 10 1909 (non-UEFI).  Performs builds in the directory where you cloned this github repo.  Artifacts are produced by default in the `./output/<MAKE_TARGET>` directory.  Packer post-processors then perform conversions and stage the completed builds in the `./completed/<MAKE_TARGET>` directory.  Temporary scripts for builds are staged in `./tmp/`.  Control over these locations is performed by modify appropriate Packer variables, or by passing a customized `variables.json` file in as a build environment variable.

Example:

* `PACKER_OPTIONS="-var-file variables.json" TMPDIR=/tmp make build-windows-10-1909-libvirt`

See the current `variables.json` for optional values that can be set.

# An Important Service Announcement on Disk Space

Because.  Windows.  Builds can take a huge amount of space if you have multiple builds happening.  The current JSON data files set the Windows disks to 20GB in size.  Just enough to install Windows.  The cleanup process will fill the entire disk with zeros to optimze.  Then a copy of the output image file will be processed - meaning that at least 2x the Disk size space is required per build. If additional post-processor copies are made, add additional Disk size multiples of disk.  It's easy to suddenly need upwards of 100GB per image build... 

Why?  Because.  Windows.

# Usage

Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (or [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) on Linux based systems), [packer](https://www.packer.io/), [packer-provisioner-windows-update plugin](https://github.com/rgl/packer-provisioner-windows-update) and [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
If you are using Windows and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), you can install everything with:

```batch
choco install -y virtualbox packer packer-provisioner-windows-update vagrant msys2
```

To build the base box based on the [Windows Server 2019 Evaluation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019) ISO run:

```bash
make build-windows-2019-libvirt # or make build-windows-2019-virtualbox
```

If you want to use your own ISO, you need to manually run the `packer` command, e.g.:

```bash
packer build -var iso_url=<ISO_URL> -var iso_checksum=<ISO_SHA256_CHECKSUM> -only=windows-2019-amd64-virtualbox windows-2019.json
```

**NB** if the build fails with something like `Post-processor failed: write /tmp/packer073329394/packer-windows-2019-amd64-virtualbox-1505050546-disk001.vmdk: no space left on device` you need to increase your temporary partition size or change its location [as described in the packer TMPDIR/TMP environment variable documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/other/environment-variables.html#tmpdir).

**NB** if you are having trouble building the base box due to floppy drive removal errors try adding, as a
workaround, `"post_shutdown_delay": "30s",` to the `windows-2019.json` file.

**NB** the packer logs are saved inside a `*-packer.log` file (e.g. `windows-2019-amd64-libvirt-packer.log`).

You can then add the base box to your local vagrant installation with:

```bash
vagrant box add -f windows-2019-amd64 windows-2019-amd64-virtualbox.box
```

And test this base box by launching an example Vagrant environment:

```bash
cd example
vagrant plugin install vagrant-windows-sysprep
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox # or --provider=libvirt
```

**NB** if you are having trouble running the example with the vagrant libvirt provider check the libvirt logs in the host (e.g. `sudo tail -f /var/log/libvirt/qemu/example_default.log`) and in the guest (inside `C:\Windows\Temp`).

Then test with a more complete example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rgl/customize-windows-vagrant
cd customize-windows-vagrant
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox # or --provider=libvirt
```


## libvirt

Build the base box for the [vagrant-libvirt provider](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt) with:

```bash
make build-windows-2019-libvirt
```

If you want to access the UI run:

```bash
spicy --uri 'spice+unix:///tmp/packer-windows-2019-amd64-libvirt-spice.socket'
```

**NB** the packer template file defines `qemuargs` (which overrides the default packer qemu arguments), if you modify it, verify if you also need include the default packer qemu arguments (see [builder/qemu/step_run.go](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/blob/master/builder/qemu/step_run.go) or start packer without `qemuargs` defined to see how it starts qemu).


## VMware vSphere

Download the Windows Evaluation ISO (you can find the full iso URL in the [windows-2019-vsphere.json](windows-2019-vsphere.json) file) and place it inside the datastore as defined by the `vsphere_iso_url` user variable that is inside the [packer template](windows-2019-vsphere.json).

Download the [VMware Tools VMware-tools-windows-&lt;SAME_VERSION_AS_IN_PACKER_TEMPLATE&gt;.iso](https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/index.html) file into the datastore defined by the `vsphere_tools_iso_url` user variable that is inside the [packer template](windows-2019-vsphere.json).

Download [govc](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases/latest) and place it inside your `/usr/local/bin` directory.

Install the [vsphere vagrant plugin](https://github.com/nsidc/vagrant-vsphere), set your vSphere details, and test the connection to vSphere:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vsphere
vagrant plugin install vagrant-windows-sysprep
cd example
cat >secrets.sh <<'EOF'
export GOVC_INSECURE='1'
export GOVC_HOST='vsphere.local'
export GOVC_URL="https://$GOVC_HOST/sdk"
export GOVC_USERNAME='administrator@vsphere.local'
export GOVC_PASSWORD='password'
export GOVC_DATACENTER='Datacenter'
export GOVC_CLUSTER='Cluster'
export GOVC_DATASTORE='Datastore'
export VSPHERE_ESXI_HOST='esxi.local'
export VSPHERE_TEMPLATE_FOLDER='test/templates'
# NB the VSPHERE_TEMPLATE_NAME last segment MUST match the
#    builders.vm_name property inside the packer tamplate.
export VSPHERE_TEMPLATE_NAME="$VSPHERE_TEMPLATE_FOLDER/windows-2019-amd64-vsphere"
export VSPHERE_TEMPLATE_IPATH="//$GOVC_DATACENTER/vm/$VSPHERE_TEMPLATE_NAME"
export VSPHERE_VM_FOLDER='test'
export VSPHERE_VM_NAME='windows-2019-vagrant-example'
export VSPHERE_VLAN='packer'
EOF
source secrets.sh
# see https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/blob/master/govc/USAGE.md
govc version
govc about
govc datacenter.info # list datacenters
govc find # find all managed objects
```

Build the base box with:

```bash
make build-windows-2019-vsphere
```

Try the example guest:

```bash
source secrets.sh
echo $VSPHERE_TEMPLATE_NAME # check if you are using the expected template.
vagrant up --provider=vsphere
vagrant ssh
exit
vagrant destroy -f
```

### Non-Administrator account

The above example uses the administrator account, but you can use a
less privileged account like in the following example.

#### Example

First, review the glossary:

<dl>
<dt>Privilege</dt>
<dd>The ability to perform a specific action or read a specific property.</dd>
<dt>Role</dt>
<dd>A collection of privileges. Roles provide a way to aggregate all the individual privileges that are required to perform a higher-level task.</dd>
<dt>Permission</dt>
<dd>Consists of a user or group and an assigned role for an inventory object.</dd>
</dl>

Then follow the next steps to create an example configuration.

In the vSphere Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration page create a `Vagrants` group and add your non-administrator user to it.

In the vSphere Access Control page create a `Vagrant` role with the privileges:

* Datastore
  * Allocate space
* Network
  * Assign network
* Resource
  * Assign virtual machine to resource pool
* Virtual machine
  * Provisioning
    * Deploy template

In vSphere configure the following Inventory Objects permissions:

| Inventory Object | Role          | Principal (User or Group) | Propagate |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Datacenter       | Vagrant       | VSPHERE.LOCAL\Vagrants    | yes       |
| test             | Administrator | VSPHERE.LOCAL\Vagrants    | yes       |

**NB** `test` is a folder that will store the virtual machines launched by `vagrant`.

For more information see the [vSphere Virtual Machine Administration/Required Privileges for Common Tasks document](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-4D0F8E63-2961-4B71-B365-BBFA24673FDB.html) in the [vSphere Virtual Machine Administration manual](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-55238059-912E-411F-A0E9-A7A536972A91.html).


## WinRM access

You can connect to this machine through WinRM to run a remote command, e.g.:

```batch
winrs -r:localhost:55985 -u:vagrant -p:vagrant "whoami /all"
```

**NB** the exact local WinRM port should be displayed by vagrant, in this case:

```plain
==> default: Forwarding ports...
    default: 5985 (guest) => 55985 (host) (adapter 1)
```


# WinRM and UAC (aka LUA)

This base image uses WinRM. WinRM [poses several limitations on remote administration](http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/safely-running-windows-automation-operations-that-typically-fail-over-winrm-or-powershell-remoting),
those were worked around by disabling User Account Control (UAC) (aka [Limited User Account (LUA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-lua-settings-enablelua)) in `autounattend.xml`
and [UAC remote restrictions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/951016/description-of-user-account-control-and-remote-restrictions-in-windows)
 in `winrm.ps1`.

If needed, you can later enable them with:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System' -Name EnableLUA -Value 1
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System' -Name EnableLUA -Value 1
Remove-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System' -Name LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy
Restart-Computer
```

Or disable them with:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System' -Name EnableLUA -Value 0
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System' -Name EnableLUA -Value 0
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System' -Name LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy -Value 1 -Force
Restart-Computer
```


# Windows Unattended Installation

When Windows boots from the installation media its Setup application loads the `a:\autounattend.xml` file.
It contains all the answers needed to automatically install Windows without any human intervention. For
more information on how this works see [OEM Windows Deployment and Imaging Walkthrough](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn621895.aspx).

`autounattend.xml` was generated with the Windows System Image Manager (WSIM) application that is
included in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK).

## Windows ADK

To create, edit and validate the `a:\autounattend.xml` file you need to install the Deployment Tools that
are included in the [Windows ADK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit).

If you are having trouble installing the ADK (`adksetup`) or running WSIM (`imgmgr`) when your
machine is on a Windows Domain and the log has:

```plain
Image path is [\??\C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\amd64\DISM\wimmount.sys]
Could not acquire privileges; GLE=0x514
Returning status 0x514
```

It means there's a group policy that is restricting your effective permissions, for an workaround,
run `adksetup` and `imgmgr` from a `SYSTEM` shell, something like:

```batch
psexec -s -d -i cmd
adksetup
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\WSIM"
imgmgr
```
