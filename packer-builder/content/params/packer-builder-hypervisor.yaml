Name: "packer-builder/hypervisor"
Description: "Select the hypervisor to setup."
Documentation: |
  Defines the supported hypervisor to deploy for the Packer images to be built
  by.

  The default value is ``kvm``.

  The currently tested and automated hyperviser deployment is KVM on either
  CentOS or Ubuntu platforms.  Other close linux distro variantes may also
  work, but have not been tested.

  The Packer JSON builds support KVM (libvirt), VirtualBox, and vSphere.  Building
  images can be done utilizing this content pack for other hypervisor versions
  if the operator sets up the hypervisor by hand first.

  The list of Packer JSON supported hypervisor build environments is below.  Note
  that this list has not been extensively tested, and debugging of various
  hypervisor configuraions may be required if you use anything except ``kvm`` type.

    * ``kvm``
    * ``virtualbox``
    * ``vsphere``
