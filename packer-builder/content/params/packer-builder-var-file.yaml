Name: "packer-builder/var-file"
Description: "Specify a custom 'variables' file for the Packer build."
Documentation: |
  If a value is set for this Param, the Packer build will use this file
  as the variables override.  If this is not set, then the default
  of ``variables.json`` in the packer directory will be used.

  .. warning:: To utilize a custom variables set of values, the operator must first
               render or make available the JSON variables file on the system that
               the content will run on.

  Example value for this Param:  ``/tmp/variables.json``

  The file specified *must* be in valid JSON format.  You may specify
  only the specifc build variables that you wish to override, otherwise,
  the embedded Variable references in each target build will take
  precedence.

  An example of valid JSON format for setting variables is below (this
  is an example of the files content that should be rendered for use on
  the system):

    ::

      {
        "disk_size": "20480",
        "output_directory": "output",
        "complete_directory": "complete",
        "winrm_username": "vagrant",
        "winrm_password": "vagrant",
        "ssh_username": "rocketskates",
        "ssh_password": "RocketSkates"
      }

  .. note:: The above example may not be the most up to date set of variables that
            are available to override in the JSON files.  Please see the file named
            ``variables.json`` in the ``packer`` directory for more recent options.

  Most notably - the ``output_directory`` and ``complete_directory`` should be
  located on a filesystem with sufficient space for the builds.  Windows builds can
  take *MASSIVE GOBS* of disk space - basically plan for a minimum of 4x the ``disk_size``
  variable setting to be completely safe.
