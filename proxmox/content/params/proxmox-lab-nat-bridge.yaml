Name: proxmox/lab-nat-bridge
Description: The name of the NAT bridge to create for Virtual Machines.
Documentation: |
  This param is used to define the name of the Bridge that will be created
  for attaching Virtual Machines which should be NAT (Masqueraded).  It will
  be attached to the primary bridge defined by ``proxmox/lab-drp-external-bridge``
  Param.

  NAT Masquerading will be set up for ``proxmox/lab-nat-subnet``.  There are no
  DHCP services setup automatically.  Either statically assign IP addresses from
  that range, or enable a DRP Subnet for that range on the ``proxmox/lab-nat-bridge``
  interface.

  The default is ``vmnat0``.
