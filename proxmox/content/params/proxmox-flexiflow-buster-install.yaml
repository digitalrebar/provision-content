Name: "proxmox/flexiflow-buster-install"
Description: "Defines tasks to inject to 'flexiflow-buster-install' workflow."
Documentation: |
  This Param contains an Array of Strings that will define which tasks to dynamically
  add to the ``flexiflow-buster-install`` workflow on first boot.

  This is generally used to specify the network setup stages in the base Hypervisor,
  before creating any target DRP or Machine VMs.  For example, the following tasks
  set network configuration up:

    * ``network-simple-bridge-with-external-addressing``

  To create a simple bridge, with an IP address assigned block to allocate to the
  "external" interfaces of the DRP Endpoint Virtual Machines.  IP addressing for the
  DRP Endpoints must be provided by the external network (external to the Hypervisor),
  either via DHCP, or static assignment.  The DRP endpoints are essentially bridged
  to the Hypervisors physical external network.

  Another example:

    * ``network-convert-interface-to-bridge``

  The above migrates the IP Address on the base interface on the Proxmox Hypervisor to
  a bridge (identified by the Param ``proxmox/lab-network-external-interface``), the
  DRP Endpoint VMs external interface are then attached to this bridge.

    * ``network-add-nat-bridge``

  The above creates an additional bridge to abstract the connection from the Hypervisors
  main NIC and Bridge, connecting the DPR Endpoints to this bridge.  NAT Masquerading
  or similar constructs must be used to provide outbound network connectivity to the DRP
  Endpoints.

  .. warning:: The ``network-add-nat-bridge`` current NAT Masquerading mechanisms do not
               appear to correctly work reliably.  This method requires additional testing
               and development.
