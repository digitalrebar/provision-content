Name: proxmox/lab-base-tag
Description: The base tag assigned to resources (eg bridge devices, etc.).
Documentation: |
  The base tag that is assigned to various resources used in the content pack
  when configuring the student lab.  For example, network bridge devices.

  This is also used when tearing things down.

  .. note:: Do not add a trailing dash, one will be inserted between the prefix
            and the numerical designator for the resource.

  The default value is ``student``, which will produce bridge devices like ``br-student-1``.
