Name: proxmox/install-drp-on-hypervisor
Description: If set to true, install DRP on the Proxmox Hypervisor.
Documentation: |
  Depending on the network configuration used on the Hypervisors, the DRP
  Endpoint VMs may or may not need to be provisioned from the Hypervisor.

  In the event that the DPR Virtual Machines do not obtain DHCP and PXE from
  outside of the Hypervisor, then the operator will have to arrange to install
  an OS on the DRP VMs.  The main workflows include a DRP Install on the
  Hypervisor task.

  If this Param is set to ``true`` (NOT the default), then DRP will be installed
  in a very opinionated configuration.
