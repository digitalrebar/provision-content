Name: proxmox/package-selections
Description: Defines the packages selected to be installed in Debian.
Documentation: |
  This parameter defines the Package selection list to install initially.
  This list should contain at least ``proxmox-ve`` and any necessary
  supporting packages.

  If the operator overrides the Default values specified in this Param,
  all packages must be specified in the updated Param values.

  The list is a space separated string that must contain valid Debian
  package names.  These packages must be available in the default repos
  unless additional ``apt`` repos have been setup and initialized prior
  to this task run.

  .. note:: The default workflows assume ``postfix`` and ``samba`` packages
            are installed (as specified by proxmox requirements).  There are
            special tasks for staging ``apt-set-selections`` to automate these
            package installation successfully.  If additional packages requiring
            input are added, the operator must implement a set of ``apt-set-selections``
            appropriate to that package.
