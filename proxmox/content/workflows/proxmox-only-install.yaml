Name: proxmox-only-install
Description: "Install only Proxmox on top of an existing Debian 10 (Buster) system."
Documentation: |
  Starts the Proxmox install.  Assumes that the install is on an
  existing/already built Debian 10 (Buster) system, update
  the system, add the Proxmox repositories, provide a minimal preseed
  set of answers (for *Samba* and *Postfix* packages), and then do
  a Proxmox install of the latest stable version.

  The special stage ``flexiflow-buster-install`` is added to this workflow.
  By setting the Param ``proxmox/flexiflow-buster-install`` to your
  target machine, the individually listed Tasks will be injected in
  to the Workflow dynamically.

  This is used to flexibly inject network config/reconfig Tasks to
  allow for dynamic use of the workflow.  For example, setting the
  Param ``proxmox/flexiflow-buster-install`` as follow (in JSON example):

    ::

      ["network-convert-interface-to-bridge"]


  Will inject that named task to modify the network by converting the
  Boot interface to be enslaved by the Bridge for Virtual Machines.

  Another example (again, in JSON format):

    ::

      ["network-convert-interface-to-bridge","network-add-nat-bridge"]

  This will perform the primary boot interface conversion to be
  enslaved by the bridge, but also bring up a NAT Masquerade bridge
  to attach machines to.
