Proxmox
-------

This content pack managed deployment of Proxmox nodes and configuration for
sutdent training labs.  At some point in the future, this will likely be
broken out in to two content packs.

.. note:: Proxmox deployments are not designed to be automated, there are
          serious challenges with automation.

This content pack currently uses a customized ISO to PXE boot and install
the Proxmox server over the network.  This is not the best approach.  The
correct approach for automation is to deploy a Debian Buster 10 system with
appropriate baseline configuration, then to install the Proxmox packages on
top of them.


Installation of Proxmox
=======================

Use the ``proxmox-rackn`` Bootenv to install Proxmox.  There is no workflow
for the installation.  Simply clear the existing workflow on the target
machine, then set the BootEnv.

You will need to log in to the console of the target machine and answer the
4 or 5 GUI based install form inputs.  Once that has been completed, the
rest of this content pack is fully automated.


Setup a Runner (Agent) for Workflow
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The RackN customized ISO does not (at this time) embed the Digital Rebar
Platform Runner (agent; drpcli) in to the ISO image.  This will be corrected
with automation rewrite to use Debian Buster and packages on top of Buster.

You will need to perform the following tasks to enable Workflow automation
of the Proxmox server - which the rest of this documentation relies on.

  ::

    # ssh to the Proxmox system
    # initiate the DRP Join script process
    wget http://$drp:8091/machines/join-up.sh | bash -s

This will create a new Machine Object for the Proxmox node.  You will need
to run the following Stages to install the AGent permanently, and optionally
install SSH access keys:

  * drp-agent
  * access-keys


Configure Student Labs
======================

The student labs can be configured by running the ``proxmox-lab-setup``
workflow on the target.


Destroying Lab Setup
====================

The workflow ``proxmox-lab-destroy`` will destroy all virtual machines on the proxmox
node, then strip off any bridge configurations in /etc/network/interfaces.d
