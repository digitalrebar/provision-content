This content pack manages deployment of Proxmox nodes and configuration for
student training labs.  At some point in the future, this will likely be
broken out in to two content packs.

This content pack utilizes the Debian 10 (Buster) *bootenv* as a baseline for
the Proxmox installation.  The Proxmox released "appliance ISO" is not network
installable by default, and requires a fair amount of work to rip apart the ISO
and rebuild it to make it network installable.


Installation of Proxmox
-----------------------

Installation is performed with the ``proxmox-buster-install`` Workflow.  This workflow
requires the ``drp-community-content`` to install Debian 10 (Buster) on the target
systems.  Configuration of Proxmox is performed via RackN Workflow stages.  Please
start by reviewing the provided workflow before attempting to rework the workflows
for your use case.

The goal of the workflow is to perform initial installation and setup of Proxmox
with a basic Virtualized network configuration on top of Proxmox.  More advanced
operational (i.e. *day two*) workflow patterns have not been developed yet.

There are some "destroy" workflows or stages that are designed to remove the virtualized
infrastructure on top of Proxmox.

Debian 10 prerequisites require human input to the packaging system.  To get around
this, we utilize the ``debconf-set-selections`` mechanism to preseed the answers to
those packages (eg Samba and Postfix).  Currently the preseed answers are hard coded
but future implementations should allow injection of specific override answers.

If you need to rely on Postfix or Samba mechanisms, you may still need to reconfigure
these packages to be correct for your use case.
