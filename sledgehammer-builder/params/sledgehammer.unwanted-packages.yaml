Description: Packages that should be removed before creating Sledgehammer
Documentation: |
  On a freshly installed Centos syhstem, there are generally several
  packages that are installed by default but that are not required for
  Sledgehammer ot do its job.  This param contains a list of such packages.
Schema:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
  default:
    # cronie is a cron replacement.
    # We should not be running periodic tasks in Sledgehammer.
    # If you really need to, use a systemd timer unit instead.
    - cronie
    # Sledgehammer will only have sshd as a network-aware listening service,
    # and is supposed to be ephemeral.  Setting up and managing firewall
    # rules is extra overhead that we don't need.
    - firewalld
    # Geolocation code and databases mostly used for finding the
    # closest mirrors.  We are explicit about mirrors used, so
    # no need for this either.
    - "'geolite2*'"
    # Wireless nic firmware.  We explicitly don't support operating
    # over wireless nics, as they all require extra configuration beyond
    # DHCP.
    - "'i*-firmware'"
    # Sledgehammer uses systemd-network instead of NetworkManager.
    - NetworkManager
    # Nothing we do by default needs a Javascript interpreter.
    - mozjs60
    # We don't need fancy boot splash screen progress bars, or even
    # graphical consoles for that matter.
    - plymouth
    # We explicitly only want to use the minimal selinux enforcement
    # policy instead of the more comprehensive targeted one.
    - selinux-policy-targeted
    # We don't care about LDAP authentication or single sign on.
    # If you need to log in to Sledgehammer, use SSH.
    - "'sssd*'"
