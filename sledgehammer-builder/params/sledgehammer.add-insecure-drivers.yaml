Description: A list of extra tasks to add to customize Sledgehammer
Documentation: |
  If you want to build a customized Sledgehammer, the supported way to
  do it is to create additional tasks to perform whatever other
  customization steps you want to perform, and then add them to this
  list.  They will be performed after the built-in extra package
  installation, and before discarding unneeded packages and conversion
  to a Sledgeahmmer image.

  Any extra customization tasks should make sure that no extra bits
  wind up in the final Sledghammer image. THis includes removing any
  unneedeed documentation, source code, or additional packages and files
  that are not needed to support proper operation of Sledgehammer.
Schema:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
  default: []
