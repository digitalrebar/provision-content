Name: sledgehammer/unwanted-kernel-modules
Description: Kernel modules to omit from Sledgehammer
Documentation: |
  The default kernel in Sledgeahmmer includes a lot of additional modules
  that are neither required nor wanted ion a datacenter provisioning
  enviromnent.  This parameter controls which drivers we will get rid of.
Schema:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
  default:
    - drivers/bluetooth
    # Graphics accelleration.  Deleting this allows us
    # to remove quite a few large firmware blobs.
    - drivers/gpu
    # ISDN support.  Also pulls in several large-ish firmware blobs.
    - drivers/isdn
    # CANbus.  You probably are not using this in a datacenter.
    - drivers/net/can
    # Wireless.
    - drivers/net/wireless
    # Asynchronus transfer mode.  You probably don't have an inordinate
    # fondness for 53 byte packets transferred over USB.
    - drivers/usb/atm
    # USB imaging device support.
    - drivers/usb/image
    # Some crazy IoT low power network that uses IPv6 natively.
    - net/6lowpan
    # We removed all the drivers, so we don't need the protocol side either.
    - net/bluetooth
    # Ditto
    - net/wireless
    # Silence is golden. You wouldn't be able to hear anything over
    # the fans anyways.
