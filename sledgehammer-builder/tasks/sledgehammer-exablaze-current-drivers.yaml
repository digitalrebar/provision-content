Name: sledgehammer-exablaze-current-drivers
Description: Install updated Exablaze drivers in Sledgehammer
Documentation: |
  This task installs up-to-date Exablaze drivers from the source
  repo defined in the sledgehammer/exablaze-driver-repo param.

  This task is not included in Sledgehammer by default -- to include it,
  add it to sledgehammer/customize-tasks and rebuild Sledgehammer.

  Please note that a Sledgeahmmer image built using this task will not
  be compatible with UEFI Secure Boot, as the resulting kernel modules
  will not be signed by the CentOS signing authority.

  THIS DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE DKMS IS NOT FUNCTIONAL IN SLEDGEHAMMER.
  NEED SOURCE STYLE FOR THIS.
