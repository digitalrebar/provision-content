This content pack contains the workflows and profiles needed to build Sledgehammer on CentOS 8.  Additionally,
the content pack contains profiles the build expanded drivers for Sledgehammer (exablaze, mellanox, solarflare smart nics).

Design
------

Following the standard RackN Digital Rebar methods, a workflow is used to build the new sledgehammer on a machine.  The
machine can be virtual or physical, but must have internet access.

The process drives the machine through a centos 8 installation, customs the image for sledgehammer usage, and uploads
the resulting image and profiles into DRP for usage.

Customizations can be done through the parameters.  This includes injecting additional tasks or data.  See the
``sledgehammer/customize-tasks`` parameter for more details.

Prerequisites
-------------

DRP Requirements
================

DRP requires a couple of things to make this happen.

#. The ``drp-community-content`` content pack needs to be loaded.  This can be done through the Catalog UX page.
#. The ``sledgehammer-builder`` content pack needs to be loaded.  This can be done through the Catalog UX page.
#. The CentOS 8 iso needs to be loaded into DRP.  This can be done by running: ``drpcli bootenvs uploadiso centos-8``

That should prepare DRP for building sledgehammer.

Machine Requirements
====================

To build sledgehammer, a machine is needed to do an install of centos 8 and then post installation work to capture the image.

The machine needs at least 2GB of memory and 20GB of storage.  The machine needs to be able to PXE to DRP and get discovered.
Additionally, the machine needs to be able to access the internet.  This could be through a second interface with DHCP,
see the ``sledgehammer/extra-ifs`` parameter.

NOTE: This will be destructive to the machine in question.

Outbound Access
===============

The target machine **MUST** have outbound internet access to get packages and components needed to build sledgehammer.
To that end, there is a parameter, ``sledgehammer/extra-ifs`` that can be used to cause DHCP to run on secondary interfaces.
This is particularly useful for VMs that have a second interface that has internet access.

Building Sledgehammer
---------------------

The following steps will produce a new sledgehammer image.

#. Discover machine into DRP as normal.
#. (Optional) Add ``sledgehammer-full-drivers`` profile to the machine if you wish to include the additional nic drivers.
#. Set the workflow on the machine to: ``sledgehammer-build``
#. Wait for the workflow to complete.

Upon completion, there will be a new iso in the isos directory and a new profile in the profiles view for the new sledgehammer.
These are named by the checksum of the image.  The last job log for the process contains the name if you are running this
multiple times.
