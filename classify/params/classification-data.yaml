  This object defines a series of tests to determine the classification
  of a Machine followed by a list of actions to apply to that Machine
  if the test is successful.

  The order of precedence is important!  A Machine will be evaluated in
  the order you specify in the tests below.  Generally speaking, you
  should order the MOST SPECIFIC tests first, followed by general tests
  next.  The very last test in the example below would be a default
  in the event no previous tests matched.

  Setting "continue: true" in this Param data structure will allow the
  classifier to continue classifying after the first match.  This
  effectively allows the operations to continue multiple tests/actions
  sequences, instead of exiting on first match.

  If none of the tests match, then the Machine will not be modified.

  The object should look like this.

  .. highlight:: yaml

  ::
    - test: "has_mac 00:11:22:33:44:55"
      continue: true
      actions:
        - "add_profile profile_name_1"
        - "change_workflow workflow_name_1"
    - test: "in_subnet 192.168.0.0/24"
      actions:
        - "set_parameter param_name value"
        - "add_profile profile_name_2"
        - "change_workflow workflow_name_2"
    - test: "always"
      actions:
        - "change_workflow wait-for-input"
  ..

  In the above example, the "has_mac" test will be applied, if the test
  passes, it would normally exit the Classifier.  However, the "continue"
  operator has been set to "true", so the tests will continue to the next
  ("in_subnet"), and subsequently if passing that test, will apply the
  actions specified.

  EXTENDING CLASSIFIER tests AND actions

  The classifier can be extended to add custom "test" and "actions" groups.
  See the "classify/custom-functions" Param for details.
