Name: "classify/custom-functions"
Description: "Add custom templates to the Classifier (presumably additional match Functions)"
Documentation: |
  Use this Param to specify additional custom templates to include in to
  the Classifier.

  This is intended to inject BASH "function NAME { ... }" stanzas in the
  classifer to provide custom function blocks to extend the tests and/or
  actions you can apply to the classifier.

  **YAML Example**

  .. code-block:: yaml

    - "my-classify-function-1.tmpl"
    - "my-classify-function-2.tmpl"

  **JSON Example**

  .. code-block:: javascript

    [
      "my-classify-function-1.tmpl",
      "my-classify-function-2.tmpl"
    ]

  .. note:: The executing environment is Sledgehammer with BASH scripts. You
            must ensure that the Function you inject operates correctly in
            this environment.  For reference, see the Functions in the existing
            classifier Template ``classify.sh.tmpl``.

  Any test functions should ``echo "pass"`` or ``echo "fail"`` to signal the test
  condition status and should subsequently apply the given actions specified.

  An example template named ``has_inventory_value.tmpl`` has been provided that
  the operator can use as an example test condition.
