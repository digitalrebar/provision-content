Description: "Enable or Disable the Classify system."
Documentation: |
  In some use cases, you may need to disable the classifier system
  from running when machines are being provisioned.  This parameter
  enables a fast disable, without having to remove the classifier
  itself.

  Apply this Param with the value "true" to disable the classifier,
  on any machines or profiles applied to machines, to effect disabling.

  For example, you could apply this Param to "global" profile to disable
  it globally. NOTE that normal precedence with Paramaters applies, so
  if a Machine has the Param applied also, the Machines Param value
  overrides the global value.
