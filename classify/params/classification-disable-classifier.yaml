Description: "Enable or Disable the Classify system."
Documentation: |
  In some use cases, you may need to disable the classifier system
  from running when machines are being provisioned.  This parameter
  enables a fast disable, without having to remove the classifier
  itself.

  Apply this Param with the value ``true`` to disable the classifier,
  on any machines or profiles applied to machines, to effect disabling.

  For example, you could apply this Param to ``global`` profile to disable
  it globally.

  .. note:: Normal precedence with Paramaters applies, so if a Machine has
            the Param applied also, the Machines Param value overrides the
            global value.
