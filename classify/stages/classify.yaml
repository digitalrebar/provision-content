Description: "Classify machines based upon data"
Documentation: |
  Applies classification test and action sequences to a Machine.  Operations
  allow adding Params, Profiles, etc. to the Machine object.  Based on these
  added values, subsequent stages in a workflow can utilize the information
  that the classifier has added to a Machine.

  Some examples including adding Profiles with BIOS configurations, lists
  of Firmware versions to apply by the ``flash`` content pack, etc.  In
  addition, you can use the ``flexiflow`` content pack to check if a specific
  values in a Param has been set, and based on that, switch to a completely
  new Workflow.
